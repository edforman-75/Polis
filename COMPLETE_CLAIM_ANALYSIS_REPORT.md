## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Statistics

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Total Statements** | 572 | 100% |
| **Factual Claims** (Verifiable) | 135 | 23.6% |
| **Non-Factual** (Not Verifiable) | 437 | 76.4% |

**Key Finding:** Only ~24% of statements in political press releases are verifiable factual claims. The remaining ~76% are opinions, characterizations, predictions, or value judgments.

---

## WHY 76% ARE NOT FACTUAL CLAIMS

### Categories of Non-Factual Statements:

#### 1. **Opinions & Characterizations (Est. ~40% of non-factual)**

**Examples from corpus:**
- "awful Republican tax bill" ← "awful" is subjective
- "failed policies" ← "failed" is value judgment
- "dangerous rhetoric" ← "dangerous" is characterization
- "extreme agenda" ← "extreme" is subjective

**Why NOT facts:**
- Require subjective judgment
- Different people have different definitions
- Cannot be objectively verified
- No empirical test for "awful," "extreme," etc.

---

#### 2. **Predictions & Future Speculation (Est. ~25% of non-factual)**

**Examples from corpus:**
- "will cost 15 million Americans their healthcare"
- "threatens to undermine democracy"
- "may lead to economic crisis"
- "are at risk of losing benefits"

**Why NOT facts:**
- Future tense ("will," "may," "threatens to")
- Events haven't occurred yet
- Cannot verify what hasn't happened
- May be based on projections, but projection ≠ fact

**What CAN be verified:**
- "CBO projects X will happen" ✅ (verify CBO said this)
- "Similar policy in past resulted in Y" ✅ (historical fact)
- But "X will happen" ❌ (unknowable future)

---

#### 3. **Motivations & Intent (Est. ~15% of non-factual)**

**Examples from corpus:**
- "Republicans want to hurt families"
- "Democrats are fighting for working people"
- "Trump refuses to negotiate"
- "They don't care about Americans"

**Why NOT facts:**
- Claim to know internal mental states
- Cannot verify what someone "wants" or "cares about"
- Mind-reading is impossible
- Only actions/statements are verifiable

**What CAN be verified:**
- "X voted for bill Y" ✅ (action)
- "X said they oppose Z" ✅ (statement)
- "X wants Z" ❌ (claimed intent)

---

#### 4. **Value Judgments & Normative Claims (Est. ~20% of non-factual)**

**Examples from corpus:**
- "This is wrong"
- "They should be ashamed"
- "We must act now"
- "It's unconscionable"

**Why NOT facts:**
- "Should," "must," "wrong" are normative (what ought to be)
- Cannot verify moral/ethical claims empirically
- Different value systems reach different conclusions
- No objective test for "should"

## FILE-BY-FILE BREAKDOWN

### High Fact-Density Files (>30% factual):

**booker_03_farmer_contracts.txt**
- 40% factual (legislation details, bill provisions)

**aoc_03_healthy_start.txt**
- 44% factual (statistics, program history, legislative action)

**Why higher?** These focus on specific legislation with concrete details.

### Low Fact-Density Files (<15% factual):

**warren_01_shutdown.txt**
- 12% factual (mostly opinion and characterization)

**schumer_03_tax_bill.txt**
- 15% factual (mostly value judgments about policy)

**Why lower?** These are political arguments heavy on characterization and opinion.

## DETAILED EXAMPLES: Why Statements Aren't Facts

### EXAMPLE 1: Booker Shutdown Statement

**Statement:** "Donald Trump and Republicans forced the government to shut down"

**Classification:** ❌ MIXED - Partially factual, partially framing

**What's factual:**
- ✅ "Government shut down" (verifiable event)
- ✅ "Republicans control Congress" (verifiable fact)

**What's NOT factual:**
- ❌ "forced" (characterization - implies intentionality)
- Different interpretation: "Democrats refused to compromise"
- Both sides claim the other "forced" shutdown
- "Forced" is editorial framing, not neutral fact

**Better factual version:**
- "Government shut down after failure to pass funding bill"
- "No funding agreement reached between parties"

---

### EXAMPLE 2: Warren on Health Care

**Statement:** "Republican cuts will cost 15 million Americans their health care coverage"

**Classification:** ❌ PREDICTION (not current fact)

**Why NOT verifiable:**
- "Will cost" = future event
- Hasn't happened yet
- Cannot verify future
- Based on projections (which themselves may be factual)

**What IS verifiable:**
- ✅ "CBO projects cuts will cost X million coverage" (if CBO said this)
- ✅ "Bill contains X billion in cuts to Y program" (if true)
- ❌ "Will cost X million" (definitive future claim)

---

### EXAMPLE 3: Schumer on Tax Bill

**Statement:** "It's no secret how awful the Republican tax bill is"

**Classification:** ❌ OPINION

**Why NOT fact:**
- "Awful" is subjective evaluation
- No objective measure of "awfulness"
- Different people assess differently
- Pure opinion

**What IS verifiable:**
- ✅ "Tax bill passed with vote of X-Y"
- ✅ "Tax bill includes provisions A, B, C"
- ✅ "CBO says bill will have effect X"
- ❌ "Bill is awful"

---

### EXAMPLE 4: AOC on Israel

**Statement:** "The Israeli government has now killed over 64,000 human beings in Gaza"

**Classification:** ✅ FACTUAL CLAIM (Verifiable)

**Why it IS verifiable:**
- Specific number (64,000)
- Specific event (deaths in Gaza)
- Can be checked against casualty reports
- Attributable to specific sources

**Verification needed:**
- Check Gaza Health Ministry reports
- Check international organization counts
- Verify timeline matches

**Note:** This is verifiable even though politically charged. Facts can be controversial but still factual.

---

### EXAMPLE 5: DNC on Rural Hospitals

**Statement:** "Rural hospitals were already on the brink of collapse thanks to Donald Trump"

**Classification:** ❌ MIXED - Contains facts + opinions

**Factual components:**
- ✅ "Rural hospitals were closing" (if true, verifiable)
- Can check hospital closure data

**Non-factual components:**
- ❌ "thanks to Donald Trump" (causation claim - complex)
- ❌ "on the brink of collapse" (characterization)
- Multiple factors affect hospital closures
- Attribution of causation requires analysis, not simple fact-check

---

## METHODOLOGY FOR CLASSIFICATION

### How We Determined Factual vs. Non-Factual:

#### ✅ Statement IS a Factual Claim IF:
1. **Empirically verifiable** - Can be checked against evidence
2. **Specific and concrete** - Not vague or ambiguous
3. **Past or present** - Not about unknowable future
4. **Objective** - Not dependent on subjective judgment
5. **Attributable** - Can find authoritative source

#### ❌ Statement is NOT a Factual Claim IF:
1. **Requires subjective judgment** - "good," "bad," "awful," "extreme"
2. **About the future** - "will," "threatens to," "may"
3. **About motivations** - "wants to," "intends to," "refuses to"
4. **Normative** - "should," "must," "ought"
5. **Vague** - "many," "some," "often" (without specifics)

## IMPLICATIONS FOR FACT-CHECKING

### What This Analysis Shows:

1. **Most political rhetoric is NOT factual**
   - Only ~24% can be fact-checked
   - 76% is opinion, characterization, prediction

2. **Fact-checkers must be selective**
   - Can't "fact-check" opinions
   - Can't verify future predictions
   - Can't prove/disprove motivations

3. **Mixed statements are common**
   - Many statements combine facts + opinions
   - Must separate verifiable from non-verifiable
   - "Republicans forced shutdown" = fact (shutdown) + frame (forced)

4. **Context matters**
   - Same words mean different things in context
   - "Will cost X million" could be:
     - CBO projection (verifiable attribution)
     - Personal prediction (not verifiable)
     - Definitive claim (false - can't know future)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Fact-Checkers:

1. **Focus on the 24% that are factual**
   - Waste no time on opinions
   - Identify verifiable claims
   - Prioritize consequential facts

2. **Document why things aren't facts**
   - Helps public understand limits
   - Shows you're being thorough
   - Prevents "why didn't you fact-check X?" complaints

3. **Separate facts from framing**
   - "Shutdown occurred" = fact
   - "Republicans forced shutdown" = fact + frame
   - Check the fact, note the frame

4. **Use WebSearch for post-cutoff events**
   - Never rely on training data for recent events
   - Always verify current information
   - Prevents Melissa Hortman-type errors

### For Content Creators:

1. **More facts = more credible**
   - Press releases heavy on opinion are weaker
   - Specific, verifiable claims are stronger

2. **Avoid predictions when possible**
   - "CBO projects X" > "This will cause X"
   - Attribution is more credible than prediction

3. **Define subjective terms**
   - Instead of "awful bill"
   - Say "bill that does X, Y, Z" (specifics)
