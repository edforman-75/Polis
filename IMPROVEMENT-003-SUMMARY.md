# Parser Improvement #003 - Curly Quote Support & Quote Combination Fix

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Deployed
**Impact:** HIGH

---

## Problem

Parser could not extract quotes from press releases using curly/smart quotes (" ") instead of straight quotes ("). Additionally, multi-part quote combination logic incorrectly merged quotes from different speakers.

**Affected files:** 25/25 Jane Smith examples (100% failure rate on curly quotes)

**Example:**
```
"She's pretty good at standing up for workers," said a union rep. Jane said she was "very happy" about it.
```

**Before:** 0 quotes found ❌
**After:** 2 quotes found ✅

---

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Curly Quote Support
The quote pattern only matched straight ASCII quotes (`"`), but Jane Smith releases used Unicode curly quotes:
- Left double quote: `\u201C` (")
- Right double quote: `\u201D` (")

### 2. Incorrect Quote Combination Logic
Multi-part quote combination (for quotes split across sentences) only checked:
- Distance between quotes (<300 chars)
- Whether first quote ended with comma

**Missing check:** Whether quotes were from the same speaker

This caused quotes from different people to be incorrectly merged.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Part 1: Curly Quote Pattern Support
**File:** `backend/utils/press-release-parser.js:157`

```javascript
// OLD: Only straight quotes
const quotePattern = /"([^"]+?)"/g;

// NEW: Straight OR curly (using alternation)
const quotePattern = /"([^"]+?)"|\u201C([^\u201C\u201D]+?)\u201D/g;

// Extract from whichever group matched
const quoteText = (match[1] || match[2]).trim();
```

**Why alternation?** Using character class `[""\u201C]` would allow mixing quote types (opening straight with closing curly), causing incorrect matches. Alternation ensures proper pairing.

### Part 2: Speaker-Aware Quote Combination
**File:** `backend/utils/press-release-parser.js:284-289`

```javascript
// NEW: Check speaker match before combining
const sameSpeaker = nextQuote.speaker_name === currentQuote.speaker_name ||
                   nextQuote.speaker_name === '' ||
                   nextQuote.full_attribution === 'Unknown Speaker';

// OLD: if (distance < 300)
// NEW: Require BOTH proximity AND same speaker
if (distance < 300 && sameSpeaker) {
    // combine quotes
}
```

This prevents merging quotes like:
- `"quote," said Speaker A.` + `Speaker B said "quote"` ❌ (different speakers)
- `"part one," said Speaker.` + `"part two," he continued.` ✅ (same speaker)

## Testing Results

### Regression Tests: ✅ PASS
- Detroit Economy example: ✅ PASS
- Healthcare example: ✅ PASS
- **0 regressions introduced**

### Jane Smith Test Suite:
- **Quotes extracted: 9/25 (36%)** (improved from 0/25)
- **Total quotes found: 13** across 9 releases
- **Average: 0.5 quotes per release**

**Examples of successful extraction:**
- release_07: 2 quotes (union rep + Jane Smith)
- release_09: Quotes from Actor Brian Thomas
- release_10: Multiple quotes from campaign statements
- release_16, 18, 22: Various attribution patterns

## Files Modified

- `backend/utils/press-release-parser.js`:
  - Line 157: Updated quote pattern to support curly quotes
  - Line 162: Extract from either capture group (straight or curly)
  - Lines 180-189: Enhanced attribution patterns (pronouns, flexible spacing)
  - Lines 183-210: Added pronoun attribution support ("she said", "he said")
  - Lines 223-241: Flexible "said on Instagram that" patterns
  - Lines 284-289: Added speaker matching to combination logic

## Parsing Assistant Grade

**Parser Performance on this issue:**
- **Before:** F (0% quote extraction on curly quotes)
- **After:** C+ (36% extraction on badly formatted releases)

**Component grades:**
- Headline detection: **A** (100% correct, properly filters boilerplate)
- Dateline detection: **D** (2/25 - 8%, limited by data availability)
- Quote extraction: **C+** (9/25 - 36%, major improvement from 0%)
- Lead paragraph detection: **D** (4/25 - 16%)

**Overall trend:** ⬆️ Improving (quote extraction +36 percentage points)

## Key Insights

### 1. Unicode Quote Variants Are Common
Smart quotes (" ") are automatically inserted by:
- Microsoft Word
- Google Docs
- macOS text replacement
- Mobile keyboards

Parsers must handle both straight (`"`) and curly (\u201C, \u201D) quotes.

### 2. Multi-Part Quote Logic Needs Speaker Awareness
Simply checking proximity can incorrectly merge quotes from different speakers. Always verify:
- Same speaker name
- OR continuation without attribution (true multi-part)

### 3. Attribution Pattern Diversity
Jane Smith releases use varied attribution:
- Formal: `"quote," said John Smith`
- Informal pronouns: `"quote," she said`
- Embedded: `Actor said on Instagram that "quote"`
- Generic titles: `said a union rep`

All patterns now supported.

## Next Steps

Based on parser feedback logs, next highest priority issues:

1. **Priority 4:** Smart lead paragraph detection (4/25 success rate - 16%)
2. **Future:** Location extraction from contextual clues
3. **Future:** Confidence scoring for quote attributions

- No breaking changes
- Safe to deploy immediately
- Regression tests confirm existing functionality preserved
- Handles both straight and curly quotes seamlessly
