# Web Scraper Implementation Summary

## Overview
Built web scraping capability to extract press releases from URLs and combine page metadata with parsed content.

## Problem Addressed
Web-published press releases often have dates displayed on the page but not embedded in the text content. Example:
- Page shows: "Oct 01, 2025" (visible to readers)
- Press release text contains: "RICHMOND, Va. —" (location only, no date)

## Solution
Created `/Users/edf/campaign-ai-editor/backend/utils/web-scraper.js` that:
1. Extracts standalone date from first 10 lines of page content
2. Removes date line from content before parsing
3. Parses cleaned content using existing parser
4. Combines page date with parsed location to create complete dateline

## Key Features

### Date Detection Patterns
- Full month names: "October 01, 2025"
- Abbreviated months: "Oct 01, 2025"
- Numeric format: "10/01/2025"

### State Abbreviation Support
Added pattern to parser (line 1156) to handle abbreviated state names:
```javascript
/\b([A-Z]+),\s*([A-Z][a-z]{1,3})\.?/  // RICHMOND, Va.
```

### Dateline Combination Logic
- Page date + location from text → Full dateline with confidence: medium
- Page date only → Date-only dateline with confidence: low
- Issues logged for debugging

## Testing Results

### Test URL: Spanberger Press Release
https://abigailspanberger.com/spanberger-statement-on-government-shutdown/

**Extracted:**
- Page Date: Oct 01, 2025
- Location: RICHMOND, Va
- Combined Dateline: RICHMOND, Va — Oct 01, 2025
- Confidence: medium
- Issues: "Date extracted from page metadata, location from content"

**Content Analysis:**
- 3 quotes extracted
- 0 speakers attributed (statement format - implicit attribution not yet supported)

## Integration Points
- Uses existing `PressReleaseParser` class
- Returns enhanced parse result with `source_url` and `page_date` fields
- Maintains all existing parser functionality

## Known Limitations
1. Statement format quote attribution not detected (e.g., "Congresswoman X released the following statement" followed by quotes)
2. Date must appear as standalone line in first 10 lines of page
3. Requires visible page content (doesn't parse HTML metadata)

## Next Steps
1. Add statement format detection for implicit quote attribution
2. Test on additional URL formats
3. Integrate into main application workflow
4. Add URL import feature to editorial interface
