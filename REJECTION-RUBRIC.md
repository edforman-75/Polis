## What Triggers Rejection?

### Guaranteed Rejection (Score will be < 40)

‚úó **No quotes + No content** = -75 points
  - Even with perfect header/headline, score = 25

‚úó **No quotes + No header + Short content** = -75 points
  - Score = 25

### Likely Rejection (Usually < 40)

‚ö†Ô∏è **No quotes + Missing dateline + Few other issues**
  - No quotes (-40) + No dateline (-15) = -55
  - Need score > 60 to avoid rejection
  - One more critical error triggers rejection

‚ö†Ô∏è **No content + No header + Missing dateline**
  - -35 + -30 + -15 = -80
  - Score = 20, REJECTED

### Will NOT Trigger Rejection

‚úì **Missing dateline only** = -15 points (Score: 85)

‚úì **Unknown speakers only** = -5 to -20 points (Score: 80-95)

‚úì **Few quotes only** = -5 points (Score: 95)

‚úì **Short content only** = -5 points (Score: 95)

## Rejection Formulas

### Two Critical Errors

Any combination of 2+ critical errors likely triggers rejection:

```
no_quotes (-40) + no_content (-35) = -75 ‚Üí REJECTED
no_quotes (-40) + no_header (-30) = -70 ‚Üí LIKELY REJECTED
no_content (-35) + no_header (-30) = -65 ‚Üí LIKELY REJECTED
```

### Three or More Issues

```
no_quotes (-40) + no_dateline (-15) + unknowns (-20) = -75 ‚Üí REJECTED
no_content (-35) + no_header (-30) + no_dateline (-15) = -80 ‚Üí REJECTED
```

## How to Avoid Rejection

### Minimum Requirements (Score: ~60-70)

1. ‚úÖ Include "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE"
2. ‚úÖ Add a headline
3. ‚úÖ Include at least 1 quote with attribution
4. ‚úÖ Write 150+ characters of body text
5. ‚úÖ Add a dateline (location and date)

**Result**: Score ~85 (Good) ‚úÖ

### Best Practices (Score: 90+)

1. ‚úÖ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE header
2. ‚úÖ Clear, descriptive headline
3. ‚úÖ Dateline with location and date
4. ‚úÖ 2-3 quotes with full attribution
5. ‚úÖ 200+ characters of meaningful content
6. ‚úÖ All speakers properly identified

**Result**: Score 95-100 (Excellent) ‚úÖ

## Special Cases

### News Articles (Not Press Releases)

If content doesn't include "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE":
```
- Missing header: -30
- Usually no official quotes: -40
= Automatic -70 points
```
**Likely Score: 30 or less ‚Üí REJECTED**

### Event Announcements

Minimal event announcements often fail:
```
"Join us Thursday at 6pm"
```
- No quotes: -40
- No real content: -35
- Usually no dateline: -15
**Score: 10 ‚Üí REJECTED**

### Social Media Posts

Short posts fail validation:
```
"Excited to announce our new bill! #Congress"
```
- No header: -30
- No quotes: -40
- No content: -35
**Score: -5 (0) ‚Üí REJECTED**

## Adjustment Guidelines

If you need to adjust the rejection threshold:

**More Strict** (Reject more releases):
- Set threshold to 60 (only accept good/excellent)
- Increase critical error deductions

**More Lenient** (Reject fewer releases):
- Set threshold to 25 (only reject worst cases)
- Decrease critical error deductions

Current setting in code:
```javascript
if (validation.quality_score < 40) {
    validation.should_reject = true;
}
```

## Summary

**A press release is REJECTED if**:
- Score < 40 points
- Usually requires 2+ critical errors
- Missing quotes + something else = rejection
- Missing content + something else = rejection

**The safest way to avoid rejection**:
Include all 6 basics:
1. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2. Dateline
3. Headline
4. At least 1 quote
5. Speaker attribution
6. 200+ char body

This guarantees a score of 90+ ‚úÖ
