## Opening Topic: Car Tax

**0:01:12 MODERATOR (TOM)**
We want to begin tonight with the topic that may be the only thing that unites all residents of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the dreaded car tax. You have said that you would ax the car tax in your first year in office but you would have to replace the revenue for local governments. So, how will you come up with just over $3 billion every year? You will have 60 seconds.

**00:01:39 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
This is my former place I represent at Norfolk State University. On the car tax, we could have gotten rid of that because Governor Youngkin put it in his budget that we could get rid of it but unfortunately the Democrats decided against that so my opponent said she will get rid of it as well. But she's going to have to ask her side of the aisle how to do that. We have the money, we can do it but what I want to ask this first question is, when are you going to take Jay Jones and say to him you must leave the race. He has said that he wants to murder his political opponent and not only that, but his political opponent's children two and five years old.

**00:02:27 MODERATOR**
We are talking about the question at hand. I want to get an answer from you.

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**: I answered the question.

**00:02:40 MODERATOR**
I will give you 15 seconds to clarify.

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
As I said, we have the money, we have run budget surpluses every year that we have been in office. Over $10 billion, $9 billion of which we've given back to the Virginia taxpayer. And when I'm Governor I will have a form that says check here if you want to pay more in taxes.

**00:03:07 MODERATOR**
You said you would like to get rid of the car tax, will you make a commitment here tonight that you will make that a priority and where do you intend to find the money from local governments every year if that tax is eliminated. You have 60 seconds?

**00:03:32 SPANBERGER**
A car tax is the most hated tax in the Commonwealth of Virginia. That has been the case for many years. My husband Adam wrote a paper about the car tax. Without a plan to do it. Unfortunately my opponent went in the legislature had the opportunity to lower the car tax by 10%. Now for four years she hasn't made the effort or endeavor to get rid of this tax. I will work with anyone—Democrats, Republicans, local and state officials—to finally get rid of this most dreaded tax. In fact, it requires significant planning and cooperation, but I have a history of getting rid of hated taxes during my time in Congress. I repealed with bipartisan support, an unfair tax on firefighters, police and public servants. I have gotten rid of hated taxes in the past by building a coalition and I will do it again.

**00:04:39 MODERATOR**
How would you come up with just over $3 billion to fund that car tax for local governments?

**00:04:48 SPANBERGER**
It requires bringing people together, Democrats and Republicans, to put any and all possible paths forward on the table. You are correct that we need to ensure that the loss of the car tax doesn't mean loss of funding to our public schools.

**00:05:03 MODERATOR**
Let her clarify.

**00:05:05 SPANBERGER**
So in working together, we will work to not only repeal this tax, which requires a constitutional amendment, but ensure our communities are funded.

## Jay Jones Controversy and Political Rhetoric

**00:05:16 MODERATOR (DEANNA)**
Thank you, Tom. Our next question is about the temperature and tone of political speech. The first example has been shaping the race for Attorney General for the past week. You both will have a chance for rebuttal. Democratic Attorney General nominee Jay Jones admits he sent text messages to a colleague referencing former Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert. Here's what he wrote.

**00:05:43 TEXT MESSAGE READ ALOUD**
"Jones, three people, two bullets, Gilbert, Hiller, Pol Pot Gilbert gets two bullets to the head."

"Put Gilbert in the queue with the two worst people you know when he receives both bullets every time."

"Jay, please stop."

"LOL OK OK. Do I think Todd and Jennifer are evil and that they are breeding little fascists? Yes. Kali, you are talking about hoping Jennifer Gilbert's children will die. Jones, yes I've told you this before. Only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy."

**00:06:02 MODERATOR (DEANNA)**
Jay Jones has apologized and says he takes full responsibility for those messages. Miss Spanberger, you have called the comments disgusting and said you condemn violence. The question for you tonight is were you aware of these messages before they were released publicly and will you continue to endorse Jay Jones as the next Attorney General of Virginia? You have 60 seconds.

**00:06:45 SPANBERGER**
The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent. I denounced them when I learned of them and I will denounce them every opportunity I get. As a mother, as a public servant, as a candidate for Governor, I denounce them. It is important that candidates always denounce violence, no matter which side of the aisle violence, violent rhetoric—we should always be focused and forceful in our denouncement. And importantly, my opponent unfortunately only denounces violence when her side is the target. I hope into the future she will endeavor to denounce violent rhetoric and violence no matter who the victim. And tonight, the Lieutenant Governor—I will say, you routinely referred to me as your enemy. I am not your enemy, you are not my enemy, we are political opponents and tonight voters are here to listen to policy differences that we have.

**00:07:57 SPANBERGER (CONT.)**
We must continue to set a good example for all our children.

**00:08:03 MODERATOR**
I didn't hear an answer there on the endorsement issue, so I want to make sure—will you continue to endorse Jay Jones to be the next Attorney General of Virginia and were you aware of these text messages before they were released?

**00:08:20 SPANBERGER**
It appears that those who released the text messages held them for years so the public was unaware of who had knowledge of these text messages. I learned of these text messages the day they came out and I denounced them as soon as I learned of them. And, importantly, at this point, as we move forward, the voters now have this information, information that was withheld from them, presumably for political reasons, but the voters now have the information and it is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information.

**00:09:00 MODERATOR**
I understand what you are saying about the voters but do you still continue to endorse Jay Jones? 15 seconds, yes or no?

**00:09:09 SPANBERGER**
We are all running our individual races. I believe my Lieutenant Governor has said that about her opponent. I am running my race to serve Virginia and that is what I intend to do.

**00:09:24 MODERATOR**
We just want to clarify that what you're saying as of now you still endorse Jay Jones?

**00:09:34 SPANBERGER**
As of now it's up to every voter to make their own individual decision. I am running for Governor and I am accountable for the words that I say and for the acts I take and for the policies that I put out. I'm responsible for the policies I put out and the work I will endeavor to do tirelessly for the people of Virginia.

**00:09:56 MODERATOR**
Thank you. Miss Earle-Sears, before we get to rebuttal, because we will get to rebuttals, we have questions for you. While there is no equivalency, this next example speaks to the divided nature of our country. During the Charlie Kirk memorial President Trump said "I hate my opponent and I don't want the best for him." Is there a place for that kind of political speech?

**00:10:21 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
I'm a Christian before I'm a Republican and I'm required to forgive people. It's hard sometimes when somebody has been abusive but it's something you must do because not to forgive is almost like if someone said you drink poison thinking that it's going to affect the other person. I want to live a decent life and I don't want to not have peace in my life. So I, as I have said before, I would not say that. So that's why I'm wondering why my opponent won't say beyond it's abhorrent and disgusting, why she won't say it is not OK and that he must leave the race because Jay Jones advocated the murder, Abigail, the murder of a man, a former Speaker as well as his children who are two years—two years and five years old. You have little girls. Would it take him pulling the trigger, is that what would do it and then you would say he needs to get out of the race, Abigail? You have nothing to say? Abigail? What if he said it about your three children? Is that when you would say he should get out of the race, Abigail? You're running to be Governor.

**00:11:43 MODERATOR**
Ms. Earle-Sears, I know you are saying you would not personally say this, but do you think there is a place for that kind of example that we gave you think should come from others?

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
I'm responsible for my behavior and what I just said I would not say that, I would not speak that way. I'm from a third world country, I was born in Jamaica and when I was 10 years old I saw that kind of political violence, which is why I'm asking my opponent to please ask him to get out of the race, have some political courage. What you have done is you are taking political calculations about your future as Governor. As Governor you have to make hard choices and that means telling Jay Jones to leave the race. I have seen what it means when people are shot in the streets and thrown in the back of cars just for political purposes. I don't want to see that in America. America must never be that place and Abigail needs to say something.

**00:12:46 MODERATOR**
You are out of time. We have one more follow-up question for you before we get to rebuttals. One more question for you on the topic of endorsements. President Trump has endorsed the Republican incumbent Attorney General, do you need Trump's endorsement to win the race in Virginia?

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
I will take all endorsements, including the President. I'm working very hard for the people of Virginia. I believe in lower taxes, the people want that. My opponent, unfortunately said she's going to raise taxes. She's going to raise energy rates. That's all she wants is solar and wind. If you look outside, the sun isn't shining and the breeze isn't flowing, then what, what will you do. You are smirking and you know that the people of the southwest have a lot of energy issues.

**00:13:40 MODERATOR**
We need to get to rebuttals so Miss Spanberger, you have 30 seconds to respond.

**00:13:45 SPANBERGER**
In her response to the question that you asked my opponent proved my point which is when violent rhetoric comes from her side of the aisle she refuses to denounce it. The statement that you read from President Donald Trump was violent rhetoric that she refuses to denounce, and this is why I say you are not my enemy. And that you would stop using language like that. But I'm also glad that she began speaking about the issues of affordability because as we are talking about issues of affordability, I am the only candidate on stage who has put forth a plan to actually lower costs for Virginians.

**00:14:24 MODERATOR**
Now your turn for rebuttal.

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
What Abigail has just said is a lie that she is the only one who has affordability. Please go to SpanbergerLies.com and check that out. I don't understand why you just can't come forward and say he needs to go. We are talking about someone's life being taken from them. Have you nothing to say about that? Are you not going to address it? Really, he can't go any further. You are Governor. You are supposed to stand up for all the people. Are you saying political murder is all right?

**00:15:02 MODERATOR**
Miss Spanberger, I want to give you a chance.

**00:15:07 SPANBERGER**
Once again, I have denounced political violence, political rhetoric no matter who is leading the charge. When given the opportunity, Lieutenant Governor Earle-Sears, you have not done the same. And so when it is important, it is important that all of us set a better example. The comments—

**00:15:36 MODERATOR**
It's difficult for us to hear with both of you talking.

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**: You are not the Governor, no courage.

**00:15:43 MODERATOR**
The audience can't hear when you are talking over each other.

**00:15:47 SPANBERGER**
Excuse me I was not talking over her.

## Federal Government Shutdown

**00:15:50 MODERATOR (TOM)**
We are moving onto the next topic with Tom on federal workers.

**00:15:55 TOM**
It has been more than a week since federal lawmakers allowed the government to shut down with more than 150,000 government workers, Virginia is facing the brunt of the impact. Ms. Earle-Sears, knowing its impact on Virginia, if you were Governor now, would you ask the President to use his power to work with Democrats to reopen the government? You have 60 seconds.

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
My opponent, all summer long has been playing political football with federal workers by trying to say that she loves them more than anyone else. Well let me tell you what love looks like, it looks like Abigail calling Senators Kaine and Warner and telling them go back, do your job and vote against the government shutdown. We only need eight Democratic Senators, that's all we need, and we cannot find eight. And yet, we can find two in Virginia. When are you going to publicly say to Senators Kaine and Warner, go do your job and keep federal workers working. That's the way you stop the shutdown because right now they are having to work, especially our military, without any pay. I'm a United States Marine veteran and it is definitely hard, especially in the enlisted ranks to work without pay. You can do something about that, you are the one who has been talking about all that love. Show love, keep them in their jobs.

**00:17:26 MODERATOR**
The question that I'm looking for the answer to is would you ask the President to use his power to work with Democrats to reopen the government? 15 seconds to clarify.

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
The President has already said he would do that but before anyone gets to the President it's in the Senate. The House and Republicans have voted and it's in the Senate and all we need for it to get to the President so this shutdown stops is eight Senate Democrats. Eight Senate Democrats and we cannot find any because they are playing political football, as you have been, Abigail, all this time. Love is a verb, it's a show me, it's a doing. Love is not a shutdown. When are you going to ask Senators Kaine and Warner to please keep federal workers working?

**00:18:22 MODERATOR**
We are going to get to Miss Spanberger next on this one, knowing that shutdown's impact on Virginia, if you were Governor now, would you urge your Democratic Senators to vote to reopen the government until a deal can be worked out with Republicans?

**00:18:41 SPANBERGER**
I have joined a group of Democrats and Republicans and President Trump, urging him to come to the table, urging him to make a deal. That is how we start a path towards ending the government shutdown, with leadership from the President. The current Lieutenant Governor of Virginia has not stood up for Virginia workers because right now at this moment, when Virginia's federal workforce and contractors in communities across the Commonwealth are suffering because of this government shutdown, it is only increasing the challenge that they are facing after months and months of attacks from this White House under DOGE. The entirety of that time my opponent has made light of federal workers losing their job saying it's not a big deal.

**00:19:46 MODERATOR**
Just to clarify, you would not urge the two Democratic Senators to work with Republicans to reopen the government?

**00:19:56 SPANBERGER**
I would encourage everyone, our Democratic Senators, our Democratic House members, our Republican House members to work together and join in efforts to come back to the table. Everyone from Virginia, the most impacted state in a time of shutdown as our communities are suffering after months of attacks on our federal workforce, everyone in Virginia should be coming together in urging the President to negotiate.

**00:20:26 MODERATOR**
We are going to move on to the next topic.

**00:20:30 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
Am I not going to get a rebuttal? She has attacked me.

**00:20:34 MODERATOR**
I will give you 15 seconds.

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
You heard a lot of words from my opponent and she has talked about DOGE. I'm the one that started a men's prison ministry. Of course I care about people, it was one of the best things I did. We have created over 265 thousand jobs. I know what it's like to lose a job, how can I make light of it, but my opponent has cut and spliced my words so that it will look like I did not care.

## Data Centers and Energy Costs

**00:21:02 MODERATOR**
Next topic, data centers with my colleague.

**00:21:06 DEANNA**
Data centers are expanding across Virginia increasing power demand and expected to raise energy bills even more for all Virginians. What is your plan to make sure data centers have the power they need and Virginians don't get stuck with the bill? You have 60 seconds.

**00:21:23 SPANBERGER**
Data centers are coming to Virginia and many localities want to welcome them. And it's important that they pay their fair share. As Governor, I would ensure that data centers pay their fair share, but we have a challenge looking towards the future as it relates to our energy generation here in the Commonwealth. We are the largest net importer of energy in the country. And that requires real leadership in contending with what is an impending energy crisis. And unfortunately, as we see an impending energy crisis, my opponent has supported efforts from the Trump administration to take millions and millions of dollars of energy investments away from Virginia. This is all the while that energy costs continue to rise for Virginians. That is why in my affordability plan I laid out plans to reduce the cost of energy here in the Commonwealth.

**00:22:23 MODERATOR**
As a follow-up, you stated the data centers must pay their fair share. What does that look like to you? Are you committing to Virginians not seeing more price hikes?

**00:22:37 SPANBERGER**
There is currently an SCC case moving forward. Pending the results of that case as it moves forward, it may require action within the General Assembly to ensure that large users like data centers are paying their fair share for the energy that they consume. For anyone that wants to view the further plans that I have to reduce energy, it is at AffordableVirginia.com.

**00:23:02 MODERATOR**
Thank you. Ms. Earle-Sears, what is your idea for offsetting the high cost of data centers, energy demands and preventing additional rate hikes for Virginians?

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
The Virginia Clean Economy Act, when it was passed, every single Democrat voted for that. Every single one. My opponent has supported it. Let me tell you what it did, speaking of no energy, it took 11,000 megawatts of power immediately off the grid, Abigail, without anything to substitute for it. And all you want is wind and solar. You know it's that little thing called the technology revolution that's still happening and it's that little thing called the industrial revolution that's still happening. Businesses need power. What are you going to do about that? Let me tell you what we are doing. We have started in the southwest a micro reactor program to see how to bring energy to the southwest and make it a regional energy hub.

**00:24:11 MODERATOR**
You are out of time but I want to follow up, the question was what is your plan for offsetting those high costs of data centers, energy demands. What is your plan for making sure Virginians don't get stuck with the bill?

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
What we need is an all of the above approach to energy, we need clean coal, oil, nuclear, natural gas and yes, renewables. My opponent's only plan is solar and wind. What happens when the sun goes down, there is nothing.

## Young Professionals and Economic Opportunity

**00:24:44 MODERATOR**
We do need to move onto the next question.

**00:24:48 MODERATOR**
We have a question tonight from a Norfolk State University student. Let's listen.

**00:24:54 STUDENT**
Young people are leaving Virginia for more affordable housing and better job opportunities. What initiatives or policies would you implement to make Virginia a more attractive place for young professionals to live, work and build their future?

**00:25:08 MODERATOR**
We will start with you. How do you respond to the student's economic concerns?

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
What we have done in Virginia and what we are continuing to do is we are bringing jobs here because we want our children who were born here, raised here, we want them to stay here and we want them to do very well because we want them to create generational wealth and a good education will do that. But when a good education happens they need the jobs. We have created over 15,000 new business startups, never existed until we came into office. New business high-paying startups, then we have created over 265 thousand jobs and we have another 225 thousand job openings right now. I was just with the Governor, Governor Youngkin, out in Charlottesville where they announced 200 more jobs.

**00:26:09 MODERATOR**
Thank you very much, what economic policies or initiatives would you implement to make Virginia an attractive place for young professionals to live, work and build their futures?

**00:26:20 SPANBERGER**
I want to thank the students of Norfolk State for welcoming us to the campus and to the faculty and administration, thank you for hosting this incredible event. The young woman raised an incredibly important point. We attract people to our universities from across the country and we should want, and I do, and as Governor I will want to ensure that when they graduate they will stay in Virginia to start a business, to start a family and to start their career. The challenges that she mentioned are of housing costs and affordability issues. During the time that the Lieutenant Governor has been in office, the cost of buying a house has gone up 18%. The cost of renting a house has gone up 14%. With just an 11% increase, even just this last year, the third highest in the whole country. My opponent frequently talks about job creation, Virginia has had seven months this year of rising unemployment, the challenges are real and Virginians need someone who will put Virginia first.

## Finding Common Ground

**00:27:21 MODERATOR**
We have a very serious—spirited debate thus far. And now we are going to shift gears and my colleague will take it from here.

**00:27:34 DEANNA**
We want to see where maybe there is some shared common ground. Miss Spanberger, what qualities of your opponent do you admire? You have 30 seconds.

**00:27:44 SPANBERGER**
I admire her faith that she puts into action through her time at the prison ministry that she frequently talks about, and I admire her service to our country. Particularly as someone who chose to be an American and chose to serve, I think those are admirable traits. And frankly what makes our country and our Commonwealth a special place that people the world over come to our country to become Americans to serve in the military and in elected office.

**00:28:12 MODERATOR**
Thank you, Ms. Spanberger. [A handshake.] What qualities of your opponent do you admire?

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
From what I've seen I believe that she is a devoted mom. I truly believe that. And that she is a daughter who loves her parents, very much. And I do believe that she cares.

## Transgender Student Policies

**00:28:36 MODERATOR**
Focusing on the K-12 school system, should transgender girls who are biological males be allowed to use girls bathrooms and play on girls sports teams? You have 60 seconds.

**00:28:49 SPANBERGER**
I am a mother of three daughters in Virginia public schools and nothing is more important to me than their safety. I'm also a former federal agent and I worked to investigate crimes against children, so nothing is more important to me than the safety of all of our children. In that work in part has earned me the endorsement of Virginia's Police Association. And importantly, on issues related to what's happening in our schools in each individual community, I think it's important that we have parents and teachers, and administrators making decisions about their individual schools, not politicians. And if we are talking about the safety of our children I would ask why my opponent continues to support efforts to defund public safety and pairing on continually by this administration.

**00:29:46 MODERATOR**
The question was, should transgender girls who are biological males be allowed to use girls bathrooms and play on girls sports teams in K-12. You have 15 seconds to clarify.

**00:29:58 SPANBERGER**
In cases across Virginia, I think it's incumbent upon parents and educators and administrators in each local community to make decisions locally. There should never be nude men in locker rooms.

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**: Oh my goodness, we finally have her saying that, but you voted for that. Are we in agreement now?

**00:30:25 MODERATOR**
This is Ms. Spanberger's time. I have a follow-up question for Ms. Spanberger. Would you rescind the Youngkin administration policy requiring boys and girls to use bathrooms aligning with their biological sex?

**00:30:39 SPANBERGER**
My priority would be to ensure that local communities, importantly parents and teachers, and educators are able to work together to meet the unique needs of each school and each community. And that is important and I say that as a mother of three daughters in Virginia public schools and as someone who used to investigate crimes against children. The way that we keep our children safe is by ensuring they are safe in schools, which includes funding law enforcement and public safety.

**00:31:13 MODERATOR (TOM)**
Would you rescind the policy requiring boys and girls use bathrooms aligning with their biological sex? You have 15 seconds to clarify that question.

**00:31:28 SPANBERGER**
My answer is that in each local community, decisions should be made between parents and educators and teachers in each community.

**00:31:37 MODERATOR**
Please don't interrupt. We are coming to you next.

**00:31:45 MODERATOR**
OK. You say that you do not support biological males identifying as females playing in girls sports and have pledged to sign legislation restricting bathrooms by birth sex. Does this position discriminate against transgender girls? You have 60 seconds.

**00:32:03 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
I'm not for discriminating against anyone. What I'm saying is common sense. I'm going to answer the question. My opponent refused to answer. I will not rescind the Governor's executive order. We know that girls want to have privacy. It's really that simple. My opponent will not answer the question because she voted for men in girls locker rooms, bathrooms, and girls sports. She will refuse to protect our girls and Title IX which is simply an opportunity for girls to have their safe space. This is not hard. Are you going to change in a gym where men are nude in the locker rooms? Are you going to do that, Abigail? I don't think you will. What about girl children if they came home crying and said there was a male in the locker room? What would you do?

**00:32:59 MODERATOR**
You will have a chance to rebut. I want to make sure you both understand that. A follow-up question now. You said in supporting that bathroom legislation, this is a safety issue. Are transgender students a safety threat? Yes or no and why. You have 30 seconds.

**00:33:18 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
I'm sorry. How did you ask that?

**00:33:21 MODERATOR**
Are transgender students a safety threat? You have 30 seconds.

**LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
We know that biological men are larger in strength than women. We understand this. This is biology. If you look at football teams, you can see the difference between males and females. This is not hard. That's why I'm asking my opponent, if your little girl comes home and said she was forced to undress in a locker room with a biological boy, what would you say? She's crying. What would you say? Are you not going to answer?

**00:33:57 MODERATOR**
Now we are going to go to opportunity for rebuttal now. 30 seconds.

**00:34:04 SPANBERGER**
My opponent was asked about her record of discrimination. And importantly, my opponent has previously said that she doesn't think that gay couples should be allowed to marry.

**00:34:16 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**: That's not discrimination.

**00:34:18 SPANBERGER**
Same-sex marriage. My opponent has also previously said that she thinks it's OK for someone to be fired from their job for being gay.

**00:34:29 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**: That's not discrimination.

**00:34:32 MODERATOR**
Your time is up. Miss Earle-Sears, it's your turn for rebuttal. You have 30 seconds.

**00:34:37 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
Yes. I want you to go online. She's talking about the funding and all of that. You know who voted to defund the police? You did when you voted for the Justice in Policing Act. You voted for that and you took money from the PAC that said you must defund the police and get rid of their qualified immunity. When are you going to give back that money? Thousands of dollars. I will not defund the police or get rid of their qualified immunity.

## Reproductive Rights and Abortion

**00:35:10 MODERATOR**
We are going to move on now to reproductive rights.

**00:35:10 DEANNA**
Thanks. Abortion is legal in Virginia through the second trimester with limited third trimester exceptions. There's a push to codify abortion access in our state constitution. You have supported both a 15 week and six week abortion limit. As Governor, what would you advocate for? 60 seconds.

**00:35:31 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
My position is that the Commonwealth needs to come together and figure out where it wants to be. It won't be my view. It will be the view of the majority. My opponent has the extremist view which is abortion up until the very hour that the baby could be born. Up until the very minute. The very minute. So you would have a baby aborted on the table. What do we do then? What do we do with a full live baby?

**00:36:07 MODERATOR**
I need you to ask the question that I'm—I'm asking the questions. I want to know, what would you advocate for? I know that you just said it's not about your view. But you will have veto powers if you became Governor. So what would you be willing to support as Governor?

**00:36:28 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
I've answered the question. It's not my view. It's what the majority of Virginians want. There's a constitutional amendment. The voters will make that decision.

**00:36:41 MODERATOR**
Thank you. You say you want to keep Virginia the last bastion of reproductive health in the South. You have 60 seconds.

**00:36:52 SPANBERGER**
When the Dobbs decision was made, it was quickly clear that state after state would move to restrict abortion access. As my opponent has previously supported. In states where they further restrict abortion access—

**00:37:07 [LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS interrupting - INAUDIBLE]**

**00:37:08 SPANBERGER**
Women pregnant with very wanted children, ectopic pregnancies were sent home. Women have died. If my opponent were to become Governor, that's what she would inflict.

**00:37:24 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**: Don't lie like that. [INAUDIBLE]

**00:37:27 MODERATOR**
The voters cannot hear if you are talking over her.

**00:37:34 SPANBERGER**
I support the constitutional amendment that is moving forward that makes clear—[INAUDIBLE]

**00:37:44 MODERATOR**
It's difficult to hear her if you are talking over her.

**00:37:49 SPANBERGER**
I support the Roe standard which is what this codification of the constitutional amendment moving forward would be. That's what I will support as Governor, though I will not have a vote on it. I will support it. Importantly, my opponent has threatened murder to women who have had abortions. That's not the type of leadership we need.

**00:38:07 MODERATOR**
You're out of time. I just want to follow-up. I have to follow-up because it was difficult for me to hear and I need to make sure that I have clarity on her answer. So just to be clear. Are there any limits that you support in terms of abortion access including for minors? You have 30 seconds.

**00:38:27 SPANBERGER**
I support the current laws within Virginia which include limits on minors obtaining abortions, including limits after the second trimester. I support the current laws here in the Commonwealth of Virginia. I will take that forward as a constitutional amendment here in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

## Immigration and Public Safety

**00:38:48 MODERATOR**
Thank you. We are now going to move on to immigration.

**00:38:53 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
I thought I was going to get an opportunity to rebut.

**00:38:58 MODERATOR**
We are moving onto other topics. We have a lot to cover tonight. We will get to you on a different topic. Now it's immigration and public safety. Governor Glenn Youngkin has tasked Virginia State Police with helping ICE to remove people living in the country illegally. Miss Spanberger, you said using local and state police for ICE raids is dangerous. Are there any situations in which you would support local law enforcement assisting ICE? You have 60 seconds.

**00:39:29 SPANBERGER**
Absolutely. I'm a former federal agent. I used to work narcotics cases. I regularly worked on arrests and search warrants in partnership with local and state police as a federal law enforcement officer. Importantly, anytime there's a warrant, an arrest warrant, a search warrant to detain someone, absolutely local law enforcement, local resources should and must be employed. That's why, as my opponent has erroneously said, I never would support making Virginia, providing any sort of sanctuary policies here. Local and state law enforcement must always work with federal agencies when there is a warrant. Importantly, what I have been talking about and anytime there is someone with any level of criminality, somebody wanted for a criminal offense, absolutely that cooperation shouldn't just occur but it must.

**00:40:32 MODERATOR**
Thank you. Now Ms. Earle-Sears, you said you support local law enforcement involvement with ICE raids. But critics argue that in high immigrant communities, they are seeing fewer people reporting crimes and cooperating with police. Are you concerned about those negative impacts to public safety? You have 60 seconds.

**00:40:52 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
I'm just going to say, go to my website. We are up to number 10. She's accused me of murder which is interesting. The very person who spouted murder, you won't even say that they should get out of the race. Now you're talking about this. My goodness gracious. We have found 4000 illegals that are here. Three MS-13 gang leaders here we found. We have found communist Chinese gangs here. We have found cartel members here. They are here because my opponent did not vote to shut down our borders. Because of your vote, fentanyl came across the borders and killed five Virginians every week. Where were you when we needed you for that vote? And then out of your own mouth, you have said, the first thing you are going to do is make Virginia a sanctuary state. I didn't say that. You said that. That's your lie.

**00:41:55 MODERATOR**
Your time is up. The question was, are you concerned about people not cooperating with police, people who are here possibly illegally, for fear of being deported. That was the question we were looking for. You have 15 seconds to clarify.

**00:42:14 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
As an immigrant, I understand that the first part of obeying the laws of the country is that we have to obey the laws of the country. I am focusing on those who are criminally illegally here. We don't need them here. My opponent did not vote for the Laken Riley Act which simply said if you are criminally illegally here, murderers, rapists, pedophiles have to go back home.

## Education and Parental Involvement

**00:42:40 MODERATOR**
We are going to move onto the next topic. Education.

**00:42:44 TOM**
Thank you. Now on the topic of education. Educating children in the Commonwealth is a top issue for Virginia voters as it was four years ago. Ms. Earle-Sears. You stated you want parents more involved in their children's education. Would you include parents in designing school curriculum or should that be left up to the educators?

**00:43:06 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
Yes. I absolutely believe that parents ought to be involved in their child's education. I am my child's first teacher. I don't co-parent with the government. That's why I strongly support parents being involved in education. You know who doesn't? My opponent. She had the opportunity to vote for the Parents Rights Act but she didn't. It said this. If the curriculum is being changed, I need to know as a parent. Why did you vote against parents on that? It also said if my child is not on grade level, reading, writing, arithmetic by the third grade, I as a parent need to know. Abigail voted against the parents knowing where their child was by the time they are on grade level. Why would you do that? Why are you voting against parents? Why are you not voting for them. Then she voted against the parents knowing whether there was violence in the schools. Abigail, this is a simple question. Why did you vote for that? Why would you vote for parents not knowing if violence is—

**00:44:11 MODERATOR**
I have a follow-up question for you. I'm specifically asking not just about general involvement in education but about designing the school curriculum. Is that something you believe parents should be involved in? Should educators be taking the lead and it should be left up to them?

**00:44:28 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
As I said, parents, we are their parents all day, twice on Sundays. We are their parents. We must be involved. How will we know what's happening in the schools? How will we know if our children are being educated? When the Democratic Governor voted to shut down government, he shut down our schools. As a result, there was a learning loss. My opponent, when we wanted to reopen the schools, upon inauguration the schools must be open, Abigail said no, they must be out for a whole semester. She took all that money from the teachers union. That's what they wanted and that's what she got.

**00:45:07 MODERATOR**
Should the Governor and state agencies decide which books are in school classrooms or should parents have a voice in that decision? You have 60 seconds.

**00:45:19 SPANBERGER**
Just this week, I have spent time at my daughter's school and I have emailed with another of my daughters' teachers about her ongoing work. She should be advised that there's communication. It's important that parents are involved. As I have been.

**00:45:42 [LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS - INAUDIBLE]**

**00:45:44 SPANBERGER**
My ninth-grade daughter is here with us in the audience. It's because of communication with her teacher that I purchased the books that she will be studying. Parent engagement is important and I support the strength of our public schools. Public schools provide opportunity to students everywhere. Unlike my opponent, I do not support defunding public schools. I do not support taking public dollars out of public schools as my opponent has advocated for.

**00:46:18 MODERATOR**
We are not going to be able to get to as many topics if we keep having to give extra time.

**00:46:28 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**: She continues to lie. I'm up to lie 12.

**00:46:30 SPANBERGER**
To answer your question Lieutenant Governor. It was federal government overreach and an unfunded mandate. That's what I told my colleagues at the time.

**00:46:42 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**: If you wanted to be federal, you should have stayed in Congress.

## Marijuana Legalization

**00:46:46 MODERATOR**
Moving onto the next topic now. The topic of marijuana. You have stated your support for legalizing a retail market for recreational marijuana that prioritizes public safety. What public safety concerns do you have? You have 30 seconds.

**00:47:05 SPANBERGER**
It's important that there be transparency in what is available on the market. As a former federal agent who worked narcotics cases, who tracked transnational criminal organizations, as the only person on stage to has had bills signed into law—[INAUDIBLE]

**00:47:24 SPANBERGER (CONT.)**
The only person on stage who had a bill signed into law by President Trump restricting fentanyl flowing into our country and tightening our border security. It is the only person on stage with the endorsement of the Police Benevolent Association. It is important that we have transparency and that there is a clear market in order to be enforced. In the absence of an open and clear, externally transparent market that law enforcement is not able—

**00:48:06 MODERATOR**
Your time is up. Now we will go to Ms. Earle-Sears. The Governor has twice vetoed bipartisan efforts to legalize a retail market for recreational cannabis. Would you sign a bill legalizing the commercial sale of any cannabis products in Virginia? You have 30 seconds.

**00:48:25 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
I believe in medicinal marijuana. I believe it has value. I had a business. When I had my business and my employees came up positive for marijuana, they couldn't work for me. They couldn't drive my trucks. We were working on gas. We were working on electric. We can't afford to have people who are working and they don't know what they are doing. They will blow everything up. My opponent, I don't understand. She says one thing and she does another.

## Relationship with Current Administration

**00:48:55 MODERATOR**
Your time is up.

**00:48:58 DEANNA**
We are moving on to talk about the current administration. I'm going to be starting with you for this topic. A central theme of your campaign is, let's keep a good thing going. Is there anything that you would do differently? You have 30 seconds.

**00:49:17 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
The Governor and I have had many talks as you can imagine. We ran as a team and we work as a team. I've been previously elected in 2001 and then I left political office. I saw how badly our children were not being educated and so I came back. I said, somebody ought to do something. The Governor and I have created all of these wonderful jobs. My opponent, before the State Chamber of Commerce saying in January that she was running on the successes of the businesses that we've been able to bring here. Now she suddenly is running away from it.

**00:49:52 MODERATOR**
Is there one thing that you would do differently from Governor Youngkin? 15 seconds.

**00:49:58 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
You know who wasn't there running away from the successes we've had? My opponent. She loves everything we've done. Why would I run away? The things I'm talking with the Governor about, I'm not going to disclose here to you.

**00:50:12 MODERATOR**
OK. Governor Youngkin is wrapping up his term with positive approval ratings according to our Emerson College poll. Are there any policies or priorities you would keep if you were elected Governor?

**00:50:25 SPANBERGER**
Absolutely. Governor Youngkin has made a strong path forward on advanced nuclear, welcoming advanced nuclear here to the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is something I supported in Congress and as Governor I will continue to ensure that Virginia is a leader. I support an all of the above strategy. I think advanced nuclear is important. Places where I differ would be on the fact that Virginia lost its place as the number one place for business and we have had seven months of rising unemployment rates here in the Commonwealth of Virginia. I would work to lower costs and grow our economy.

## Favorite Virginia President

**00:51:08 MODERATOR**
Thank you. We are moving onto our next question.

**00:51:14 TOM**
We are winding down tonight. We want to end with one fun question. So this will be something that will bring a smile to our faces tonight. The Mother of Presidents is the state of Virginia. A little history lesson here. Virginia has eight U.S.-born presidents. Which one is your favorite? 30 seconds.

**00:51:34 SPANBERGER**
As a UVA alumna, I will have to go with Thomas Jefferson.

**00:51:39 MODERATOR**
Why?

**00:51:42 SPANBERGER**
He started the University. With all due respect to graduates of other universities.

**00:51:48 MODERATOR**
OK. Who is your favorite Virginia President?

**00:51:54 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
I would have to say it would have to be the very first one George Washington. He was a profile in courage. Absolutely. It's why we don't have monarchs here. It's because of him why we have a constitutional republic. Without him, I don't think we would've had all that.

## Closing Statements

**00:52:12 MODERATOR**
Thank you. We want to make sure that we get the closing statements so we will begin with you. 30 seconds.

**00:52:18 LT. GOV. EARLE-SEARS**
Thank you for coming and those of you who are listening. This is a momentous occasion and it's important. You know, I ran ministries. I have mopped the floors of a homeless shelter. I have given quite a bit of my life to service. I'm a United States Marine. I know how to defend and deliver for Virginia. I will continue to do so. I'm the only blue-collar worker in this race. Please support me for Governor.

**00:52:49 MODERATOR**
Thank you. Why should you be Governor? 30 seconds.

**00:52:55 SPANBERGER**
When I served as a federal agent at CIA and then in Congress, I always endeavored to put Virginians first. As Governor, I will do the same thing. I will always put Virginians first. Importantly at this time, when we are seeing attacks on Virginia's healthcare, workforce, and the tariffs that are wreaking havoc in our communities. My opponent has not done the same. Putting allegiance to Donald Trump first no matter the cost. I will work to lower costs, protect our schools, strengthen our schools, and keep our public safety. [INAUDIBLE]

**00:53:34 MODERATOR**
That's all the time we have. Thank you both for joining us tonight.

**00:53:44 MODERATOR (CONT.)**
One of you will be the first female governor of Virginia. A reminder to voters, Election Day is November 4th.
