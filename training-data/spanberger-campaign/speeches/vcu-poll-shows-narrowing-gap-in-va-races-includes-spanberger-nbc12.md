RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT) - With less than two months to go until Election Day, candidate ads are filling TVs and front yards across Central Virginia.
There is an all-out effort from both parties to win the governor’s mansion.
Democratic candidate for governor Abigail Spanberger continues to lead, but a new poll shows her Republican opponent, Winsome Earle-Sears, closing the gap.
That new poll from the L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University shows a narrowing gap between Democrats and Republicans across all of the state races.
The Sep. 9th poll states:
“Among registered voters, former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger leads Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears 49% to 40%, down from a 12-point margin last month. Nearly half of independents (48%) remain undecided. For lieutenant governor, Sen. Ghazala Hashmi holds a 45% to 41% edge over John Reid, compared to a 10-point advantage a month ago. Former Del. Jay Jones leads Attorney General Jason Miyares 47% to 41%, narrowing from nine points last month.”
But Larry Sabato, political analyst and director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, warns the polls should be taken with a grain of salt.
“First of all, the margin of error more than accommodates the change of three points. Statistically, it means nothing,” Sabato said. “What you can draw as a conclusion from the series of polls we’ve seen is that Abigail Spanberger has a sizable, but not insurmountable, lead in the race for governor.”
Sabato said the results on Election Day will be determined primarily by voter turnout, because most people will vote down party lines.
“The reason we have had ticket elections consistently since 2013 is because we live in a hyper-partisan era, and people have picked a party and they stick with it for the most part. Doesn’t mean that no candidate from the losing party for governor can’t win. It does mean that it’s very difficult,” Sabato said.
Spanberger and Earle-Sears told 12 On Your Side that they are using the numbers to rally their bases.
“I notice the media has been trying to really help her by saying, ‘Now this race is where Winsome is down 10 points.’ And that’s a lie and everybody knows that,” Earle-Sears said.
“We’re making sure that people aren’t taking anything for granted,” Spanberger said. “I’m certainly not taking anything for granted.”
Sabato said that what’s interesting is how both candidates are using this to their advantage.
“The Republican who’s behind is saying, ‘Look at this. You know darn well, this is inaccurate polling and we have to work even harder to overcome this handicap that’s being imposed on us by the pollsters and the media.’ And what do Democrats say? They say, ‘Don’t you believe these polls. We can’t rely on the polls. We’ve all seen what’s happened in recent elections. Don’t get overconfident.’ So it serves the needs of both parties, and they both use it, and that’s okay,” Sabato said.
According to the latest VCU poll, Virginian voters care most about the rising cost of living, followed by women’s reproductive rights, immigration and education.
“To the extent that they have picked themes that can get them elected, I think the ads are doing a pretty good job of communicating their messages. In the end, the voters will judge. And again, it’s going to be a question of which party turns out at a higher rate,” Sabato said.
Sabato also said that independent voters probably will not sway the election outcome too much because they tend to be split, as well.
Early voting begins next Friday, Sep. 19th.
If you plan to vote by mail, you have about a month and a half left to request your ballot.
