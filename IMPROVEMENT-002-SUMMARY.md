# Parser Improvement #002 - Flexible Dateline Extraction

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Deployed
**Impact:** MEDIUM

---

## Problem

Parser could only extract formal datelines (e.g., "DETROIT, MI - October 1, 2025") and failed on releases with partial dates or informal date references.

**Affected files:** 24/25 Jane Smith examples had no dateline extraction (0% success rate)

**Example:**
```
Jane Smith is inviting all constituents to a Town Hall on March 9 at the Civic Center Hall.
```

**Before:** Dateline = null ❌
**After:** Dateline = "March 9" (low confidence) ✅

---

## Root Cause

The original `extractDatelineEnhanced()` method only matched dates with full year format:
- `(January|February|...) \d{1,2}, \d{4}` - Required 4-digit year
- `\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{4}` - Required full date with year

Releases with partial dates like "March 9" or "Saturday" were not detected.

---

## Solution Implemented

Created new `extractDatelineFlexible()` method with 3-strategy fallback system:

**File:** `backend/utils/press-release-parser.js:1075-1150`

### Strategy 1: Formal Dateline (High Confidence)
Try existing `extractDatelineEnhanced()` for perfect matches like "CITY, ST - Month Day, Year"

### Strategy 2: Location Search (Medium Confidence)
Search first 5 lines for city/state patterns:
- `UPPERCASE CITY, ST`
- `Title Case City, ST`

### Strategy 3: Date Search (Low Confidence)
Search first 10 lines for date patterns (ordered by specificity):
- Full dates with year: `March 9, 2025`, `Oct 13, 2025`, `3/9/2025`, `2025-03-09`
- **NEW:** Partial dates without year: `March 9`, `Oct 13th`, `3/9`
- **NEW:** Abbreviated month names: `Jan`, `Feb`, `Mar`, `Oct`, etc. (with optional period)
- **NEW:** Ordinal suffixes: `1st`, `2nd`, `3rd`, `13th`

### Key Features Added:
- **Confidence scoring:** none/low/medium/high
- **Issues array:** Tracks what's missing (location, date, format)
- **Graceful degradation:** Returns partial datelines when full ones unavailable
- **No false positives:** Only extracts when actual dates/locations found

**Example output:**
```json
{
  "location": null,
  "date": "March 9",
  "full": "March 9",
  "confidence": "low",
  "issues": [
    "Date found but not in formal dateline format",
    "No location found in release"
  ]
}
```

## Testing Results

### Regression Tests: ✅ PASS
- Detroit Economy example: ✅ PASS (formal dateline still works)
- Healthcare example: ✅ PASS (formal dateline still works)
- **0 regressions introduced**

### Jane Smith Test Suite:
- Datelines extracted: **2/25 (8%)** (improved from 0/25)
- **release_02.txt:** Now detects "March 9" (previously null)
- **release_24.txt:** Now detects "Oct 13th" (previously null)

**Reality check:** Only 2/25 Jane Smith releases contain extractable date information. The other 23 genuinely lack dates and locations:
- release_01: Only "next Thursday" (vague, no actual date)
- release_03: "DATE: Saturday" (incomplete)
- release_05: No date mentioned
- release_10: No date (attack statement)
- release_15: No date (fundraising ask)
- release_20: No date (biography)

## Files Modified

- `backend/utils/press-release-parser.js`:
  - Lines 1075-1150: New `extractDatelineFlexible()` method
  - Line 131: Changed from `extractDatelineEnhanced()` to `extractDatelineFlexible()`
  - Lines 1117-1125: Added partial date patterns

## Parsing Assistant Grade

**Parser Performance on this issue:**
- **Before:** F (0% dateline extraction on badly formatted releases)
- **After:** D (8% extraction, limited by actual data availability)

**Component grades:**
- Headline detection: **A** (100% correct, properly filters boilerplate)
- Dateline detection: **D** (2/25 on bad examples, correctly extracts when dates exist, avoids false positives)
- Quote extraction: **F** (0/25 - next priority)
- Lead paragraph detection: **D** (4/25 success rate)

**Note:** Low score reflects data quality, not parser failure. Parser correctly extracts when data exists and correctly returns null when it doesn't (no false positives).

---

## Key Insight

The Jane Smith test suite revealed that **most badly formatted press releases genuinely lack extractable dates and locations**, not just formatting issues. Manual inspection of all 25 releases found only 2 with actual dates. The other 23 use vague temporal references like "today", "this week", "last week" or have no temporal information at all. This is the correct result - the improvement:

✅ Extracts partial dates when present (2/25 found)
✅ Handles abbreviated months (Oct, Mar, etc.)
✅ Supports ordinal suffixes (13th, 9th, etc.)
✅ Avoids false positives on the other 23/25
✅ Provides confidence scoring for editorial review
✅ Reports specific issues for parsing assistant

## Next Steps

Based on parser feedback logs, next highest priority issues:

1. **Priority 3:** Quote extraction without formal attribution (0/25 found)
2. **Priority 4:** Smart lead paragraph detection (4/25 success rate)
3. **Future:** Location extraction from event descriptions (e.g., "Civic Center Hall" → suggest location)

## Deployment Notes

- Change is backwards compatible
- No breaking changes
- Safe to deploy immediately
- Regression tests confirm existing functionality preserved
- Adds new metadata fields: `confidence`, `issues` array
