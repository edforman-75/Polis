## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Automated Testing
Run the test script to verify everything:

```bash
# Make sure server is running first
NODE_ENV=development node server.js

# In another terminal, run the test
node test-prose-enhancer.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Server is running on port 5055
✅ Test 1/3 PASSED
   Original: "We will make changes to improve things."
   Enhanced: "We will implement strategic improvements..."
✅ Test 2/3 PASSED
✅ Test 3/3 PASSED
```

### Manual Browser Testing

#### Test 1: Basic Enhancement
1. Start server: `NODE_ENV=development node server.js`
2. Open: `http://localhost:5055/press-release-canvas.html`
3. Click in "Lead Paragraph" textarea
4. Type: "We will make important changes."
5. Press `⌘⇧E` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Windows/Linux)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Yellow highlight appears immediately (before API call)
- ✅ Popover appears below the highlighted text
- ✅ Popover shows enhanced version
- ✅ Can edit text in popover before applying

#### Test 2: Keyboard Controls
1. With popover open:
   - Press `Enter` → Should apply changes
   - Click "Enhance" again → Press `Esc` → Should cancel
   - Click "Enhance" again → Press `Shift+Enter` → Should get new suggestion
   - Apply a change → Press `⌘Z`/`Ctrl+Z` → Should undo

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Enter applies changes
- ✅ Esc cancels without changes
- ✅ Shift+Enter gets another suggestion
- ✅ Ctrl/Cmd+Z undoes last change

#### Test 3: Multiple Textareas
1. Open `http://localhost:5055/press-release-canvas.html`
2. Test enhancement in different textareas:
   - Lead Paragraph
   - Supporting Details
   - Quote 1
   - Quote 2
   - Additional Info

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Works in all textareas
- ✅ Auto-detects correct textarea
- ✅ Highlight appears in correct location

#### Test 4: Error Handling
1. Stop the server
2. Try to enhance text

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Shows error message
- ✅ Doesn't crash the page
- ✅ Can continue editing

### Cross-Browser Testing
Test in these browsers:

- [ ] Chrome/Chromium (primary)
- [ ] Firefox

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production` in production
- [ ] Configure `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
- [ ] Ensure AI service API keys are configured
- [ ] Test CORS with production domain

### Performance
- [ ] Test with slow 3G network throttling
- [ ] Verify API response times < 3 seconds
- [ ] Check console for errors
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during repeated enhancements

### Security
- [ ] Review CORS configuration for production
- [ ] Add rate limiting to `/enhance` if needed
- [ ] Consider adding auth token for production
- [ ] Sanitize user input on backend

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Network Error" in browser
**Solution:**
- Check server is running: `ps aux | grep node`
- Verify port 5055 is not in use: `lsof -i :5055`
- Check console for CORS errors

### Issue: Enhancement returns original text
**Solution:**
- Check AI service is configured
- Verify `.env` has API keys
- Check `backend/services/ai-service.js` logs

### Issue: Highlight doesn't appear
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for JS errors
- Verify `suggestion-highlighter.css` is loaded
- Confirm textarea has focus when pressing shortcut

### Issue: CORS error in production
**Solution:**
- Update `FRONTEND_URL` in production `.env`
- Verify CORS origin matches your domain
- Check `server.js` line 56-72
