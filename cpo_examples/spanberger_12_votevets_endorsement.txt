VoteVets PAC Endorses Spanberger for Governor of Virginia

HENRICO, Va. — Nov 29, 2023

The first and largest progressive group of Veterans — VoteVets PAC — today endorsed U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger to serve as the next Governor of Virginia.

VoteVets PAC praised Spanberger for her consistent work on behalf of Virginia's Veterans, including her support for the bipartisan Honoring Our PACT Act. This law marks the largest expansion of U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits in a generation, and it includes Spanberger's measure to investigate the negative impacts of jet-fuel exposure on the long-term health of America's Veterans.

"Abigail Spanberger will be an incredible Governor, and we're proud to endorse her. Her career has been about her commitment to protecting our Constitution and delivering for the people she serves," said Travis Tazelaar, VoteVets PAC Political Director.

"Virginia has a proud record of military service, and our Commonwealth is home to tremendous individuals and organizations dedicated to supporting those who have borne the battle," said Abigail Spanberger.

The press release also highlights Spanberger's congressional work supporting veterans, including bipartisan efforts to help veterans access job opportunities and recognize Atomic Veterans.
