August 21, 2025

IRVINE, CAâ€”Just five months after joining the race for California Governor, Katie Porter has successfully consolidated support across the state, leading the Democratic field by double digits in every recent poll.

A new Politico poll released today found that Porter more than doubled the vote share of the next most competitive Democrat, matching other independent polling in recent months showing Porter with a commanding lead.

Porter leads with 21% in the Politico poll. Another independent poll shows her with a 13-point lead. Her support has increased by 50% since the previous poll.

Despite entering the race halfway through the last fundraising period, Porter led the field in fundraising, raising over $3 million from grassroots donors.

Porter raised over a quarter of a million dollars in 36 hours after Kamala Harris declined to enter the race.

Politico reported "Kamala Harris supporters flocked to Katie Porter in California governor's race."
