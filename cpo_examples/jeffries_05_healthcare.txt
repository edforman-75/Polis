September 30, 2025

Today, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box, where he affirmed Democrats' commitment to protecting the healthcare of the American people in the face of the reckless Republican-caused healthcare crisis.

Key points from the interview:

Jeffries strongly criticized the Republican spending bill, calling it a "partisan Republican spending bill" that would "gut the healthcare of the American people."

He emphasized that the "One Big Ugly Bill" represented "the largest attack on Medicaid in American history."

Jeffries repeatedly denied Republican claims about healthcare for undocumented immigrants, stating: "Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to provide medical coverage to undocumented individuals."

He argued that healthcare is "a central issue to the quality of life of the American people" and not an "extraneous issue."

Jeffries called for Republicans to return from vacation to negotiate a government funding agreement, stating they were "supposed to have votes yesterday and today."
