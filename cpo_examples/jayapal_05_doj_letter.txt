Ranking Members Raskin, Jayapal, McBath Press DOJ on Trump Administration's Dangerous Diversion of Law Enforcement Officials

February 5, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C.

Representatives Raskin, Jayapal, and McBath are demanding answers from Acting Attorney General James R. McHenry III about DOJ directives removing law enforcement from critical missions to focus on immigration enforcement.

Specific task forces affected include the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF), Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), and FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces.

Main Concerns:

Diverting resources from fighting terrorism, crime, and drug trafficking. Prioritizing arrest of undocumented immigrants without considering public safety. Potential risks to national security and public safety.

"Previous Republican and Democratic administrations have rightly prioritized true public safety threats for apprehension and removal."

Specific Risks Highlighted:

Increased drug trafficking potential. Allowing violent criminals to remain free. Reduced capacity to prevent terrorist attacks.

The Ranking Members requested information to understand how these actions could "undermine law enforcement, increase violent crime, threaten our national security, and enable the proliferation of illegal drugs and illegal guns."
