ANAHEIM, CA

U.S. Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) was joined by local Orange County leaders to call out President Donald Trump's ongoing attacks on California health care, including crucial services provided by Planned Parenthood, and highlight Congressional Republicans' rejection of legislation to avert massive increases in health care premiums and avert a looming government shutdown.

Schiff emphasized how the Republican budget passed earlier this summer blocks federal funding for Planned Parenthood â€“ eliminating all Medicaid coverage for the critical services and preventative care they provide for millions. At the Planned Parenthood of Orange & San Bernardino Counties, more than 130,000 Medicaid patients are at risk of losing care.

Schiff was joined by Ramona Thomas, General Counsel of Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties, California State Senator Tom Umberg, and Orange County Board of Supervisor Vicente Sarmiento.

Key quotes:

Senator Schiff: "With Trump and GOP leadership refusing to talk, we are on the verge of a destructive shutdown. Their massive cuts to Medicaid and the ACA have left us with an impending crisis in health care."

State Senator Umberg: "Healthcare is not a partisan issue-it is a lifeline for millions of Californians."

Supervisor Sarmiento: "Instead of issuing threats around the potential for a government shutdown, the administration should be focused on improving the issues directly affecting our communities."

The press release notes that Senate Republicans recently voted unanimously to reject legislation that would reverse health care cuts and prevent premium increases. President Trump also canceled a meeting with Democratic leaders aimed at averting a government shutdown.
