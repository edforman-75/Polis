One Month Until Election Day, Spanberger Remains Focused on Lowering Costs, Putting Virginia First

Spanberger: "As Virginia's Next Governor, I Will Get to Work on Day One to Bring Down Costs for Virginia Families"

RICHMOND, Va. — Oct 03, 2025

Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger today — one month ahead of Election Day — encouraged Virginians to make their voices heard and make a plan to vote early or on Election Day.

"Virginians want a Governor who puts them first. As I travel across the Commonwealth, I continue to hear from Virginians who are working harder than ever, but are still worried about making ends meet — in the face of escalating attacks out of Washington on Virginia's federal workforce, Virginians' access to affordable healthcare, and Virginia's overall economy. As Virginia's next Governor, I will get to work on day one to bring down costs for Virginia families, strengthen Virginia's economy, and make sure Virginia's public schools are the best in America," said Spanberger.

"This November — and while polls are open early, Virginians have an opportunity to make their voices heard. From now through Election Day, I will continue to listen to families across every corner of our Commonwealth and make the case for earning their vote."

The press release details Spanberger's plans for lowering healthcare, housing, and energy costs, and highlights her bipartisan record in Congress. It also provides voter resources and important dates for the upcoming election.
