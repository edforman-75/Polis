August 23, 2025

WASHINGTON, DC

Representative Ro Khanna (CA-17), member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, released the following statement on the files received by the committee yesterday from the Department of Justice:

"Only 3% of the documents given to the Oversight Committee are new. The rest are already in the public domain. Less than 1% of files have been released. DOJ is stonewalling. The survivors deserve justice and the public deserves transparency. Congress must pass my bill with Rep. Thomas Massie, the Epstein Files Transparency Act, to force the full release of the Epstein files with redactions to protect the victims. On September 3rd, I'm holding a press conference with survivors of Epstein and Maxwell's abuse. Some will be speaking for the first time. We'll hear from them why releasing this information is so important," said Rep. Ro Khanna.

What: Press conference with Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Thomas Massie, joined by Epstein/Maxwell abuse survivors
Date: September 3rd at 10:30am ET
