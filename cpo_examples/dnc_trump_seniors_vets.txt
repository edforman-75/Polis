Trump Attacks Seniors' and Veterans' Hard-Earned Benefits

May 5, 2025

Donald Trump and his shadow president Elon Musk are attacking millions of seniors' and veterans' hard-earned benefits with chaotic funding cuts, delayed Social Security checks, and "severe" shortages that force veterans to get care in crowded hallways. While Trump makes life worse for seniors and veterans to give his billionaire backers tax handouts, it's clear that his priorities lie with propping up the ultra-wealthy â€” not helping hardworking Americans.

Here's a look at the latest coverage of Donald Trump going after veterans' and seniors' hard-earned benefits:
