Jayapal Statement on Republican Government Shutdown

September 30, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C.

U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) released the following statement as government funding expired:

"Trump and Republicans control the White House, the House of Representatives, and the Senate, and they have officially chosen to shut down the government rather than deliver health care for the American people.

"Democrats have been in Washington, D.C., ready to negotiate a bill that cancels the horrific Republican cuts, lowers costs, and saves health care. Meanwhile, Speaker Johnson sent his Members home to do fancy fundraisers with billionaires and refused to negotiate.

"Once again, Republicans are choosing chaos over governing. Their shortsighted decisions will raise health care costs and devastate communities. American families will suffer."

Jayapal's office remains open during this Republican shutdown to serve her constituents.
