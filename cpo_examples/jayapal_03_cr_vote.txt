September 19, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C.

U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) released the following statement on her vote against the Republican continuing resolution (CR):

"I will not give my vote to a partisan CR that does not restore the world of hurt that Republicans have caused in their Big Bad Betrayal bill, including the cutting of health care for 17 million Americans and stripping food assistance.

"We are also in a truly unprecedented situation where Republicans have gone back on their promises in government funding by allowing this administration to claw back money for public broadcasting and foreign aid already approved by Congress. On top of this, the administration has also delayed delivery of funding passed by Congress, including critical education funding. Any CR must also include an assurance they will not continue to go back on their word and rescind further funding.

"Republicans are in control of every branch of the government, and they refuse to negotiate with Democrats on government funding. If the government shuts down on September 30th, it will be because Republicans cannot govern and refuse to compromise."
