Leader Schumer Floor Remarks On President Trump Following The Project 2025 Playbook

January 25, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) spoke on the Senate floor about President Trump's first week in office, focusing on policies from Project 2025.

Key points from Schumer's remarks:

Trump previously claimed he had nothing to do with Project 2025.

Bloomberg News reported that over 30 of 47 initial executive actions come directly from Project 2025.

Specific policy areas targeted include Medicare drug cost savings, clean energy jobs, reproductive healthcare restrictions, and prescription drug pricing.

"Project 2025 is officially Donald Trump's policy playbook."

Schumer argued that Trump's actions are making life "easier for big corporations and more expensive for average people" by implementing Project 2025 recommendations.

The press release suggests this is likely just the beginning of implementing Project 2025 policies in the Trump administration.
