WHAT VIRGINIANS ARE SEEING: Spanberger Slams Trump Administration's Promised Mass Firings Amid Shutdown

Oct 02, 2025

As the Trump Administration's government shutdown drags on and President Trump doubles down on plans to fire federal workers, Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger is highlighting the devastating impact on Virginia families and businesses.

Virginia is home to more federal workers than any state except Maryland, and the Commonwealth's economy depends heavily on the federal workforce. The uncertainty created by potential mass firings and the ongoing shutdown is already causing economic pain.

Connor Joseph, Communications Director for the Spanberger campaign, stated: "Amid the Trump Administration's DOGE attacks, tariff policies, and tax law driving up costs for Virginia families and causing chaos for businesses, Virginians are seeing their economic security threatened. Abigail Spanberger will always put Virginia first and fight to protect Virginia jobs."

Spanberger has announced her "Growing Virginia Plan" focused on protecting jobs and growing the economy. A recent UVA forecast projects virtually no job growth in Virginia for 2026, and Virginia recently lost its CNBC ranking as "America's Top State for Business."

Spanberger was previously endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 2020 and 2022 for her work supporting businesses and economic growth.
