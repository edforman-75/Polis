NEW: Spanberger Announces Priorities to Make Virginia More Affordable, Lower Virginians' Healthcare & Prescription Drug Costs

MECHANICSVILLE, Va. — May 21, 2025

Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger announced priorities to lower healthcare and prescription drug costs for Virginians. The event was held at Mechanicsville Drug Store, a family-owned pharmacy since 1957.

"Across our Commonwealth, I'm hearing from Virginians whose healthcare and prescription drug costs are one more thing that keeps them up at night," said Spanberger.

"There are concrete steps we can take right now to bring down drug prices and save Virginians money at the hospital and the pharmacy counter," she added.

"I'm excited to be here with a true leader — who I know wants to fix the issues that are hurting people here in Mechanicsville and across the Commonwealth," said Tommy Thompson, pharmacy owner.

"Because of Medicaid, my daughter can focus on her treatment without having to worry about whether or not she can afford it," said Aida Pacheco.

"We need a leader who will work to make sure no one has to worry about paying tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket for their necessary medication," said Irv Varkonyi.

Key Policy Priorities:
- Lowering costs by cracking down on pharmacy benefits managers
- Allowing more choice in pharmacies
- Combating drug cost increases
- Improving healthcare access in rural areas
- Improving hospital price transparency
- Stopping predatory billing practices
