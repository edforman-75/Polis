October 01, 2025

Washington, D.C.

Senator Warren criticizes Republicans for shutting down the government over health care cuts. She argues Democrats are fighting to preserve health care coverage for millions of Americans and claims Republicans, led by Donald Trump, are refusing to negotiate.

"Democrats want to keep the government open AND we want rollbacks of the Republican cuts that will cost 15 million Americans their health care coverage," said Senator Warren.

"Republicans control the House, Republicans control the Senate, Republicans control the White House. They are in power. It is their job to keep the government running for the American people â€” and they have failed," Warren added.

Warren highlights potential negative impacts of the shutdown, including disruptions to healthcare, childcare, and government services.

The Senator delivered a full speech on the Senate floor detailing her arguments against the government shutdown and the health care cuts that led to the impasse.
