Washington, D.C.

Senator Elizabeth Warren questioned witnesses at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on "Examining the Taxation of Digital Assets". Warren challenged proposed crypto tax provisions that she argued would provide unfair advantages to crypto investors.

"Industry lobbyists want special tax rules for crypto that will make crypto billionaires richer and give crypto an unfair advantage over other kinds of competing financial products," said Warren.

Warren argued these proposals would collectively cost taxpayers billions of dollars and create an uneven playing field compared to traditional financial products. The provisions under discussion included:

- A de minimis exemption for crypto transactions under $300
- Allowing crypto miners and stakers to delay tax payments
- Exempting crypto transactions from certain reporting requirements

Warren emphasized the principle that "same basic transaction, same kind of risks means we need the same kind of rules."

The hearing featured testimony from Andrea Kramer and Annette Nellen, who were questioned by Warren about the fiscal impact of the proposed crypto tax changes.
