WASHINGTON, D.C.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) spoke on the Senate floor against the Republicans' tax bill after the release of a CBO report showing the bill would diminish resources from the most vulnerable Americans while increasing resources for the ultra-rich.

Key points from Schumer's remarks:

"It's no secret how awful the Republican tax bill is â€“ for weeks, we've said their bill shows that billionaires win, American families lose."

The CBO's nonpartisan analysis shows the bill would decrease household resources by 4% for the bottom 10% and increase household resources by 2% for the top 10%.

Schumer argued the bill would hurt American families by reducing healthcare, cutting food benefits, eliminating jobs, and reducing income.

"The bottom line: American families lose. Billionaires win."
