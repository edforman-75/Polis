Governor Stein Advocates for Western North Carolina's Recovery in Washington, D.C.

Wednesday, September 17, 2025

RALEIGH, NC - Governor Josh Stein traveled to Washington, D.C. today with local officials from several western North Carolina counties to advocate for $13.5 billion in new funding for Hurricane Helene recovery.

Governor Stein met with Trump administration officials, members of Congress, and Senators to press the case for additional federal support.

"It's been nearly a year since Hurricane Helene, and while we are grateful for every dollar of federal support we have received, we need more," said Governor Stein.

FUNDING REQUEST BREAKDOWN:

- $8 billion for Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery
- $400 million in forgivable small business loans
- $1.6 billion for U.S. Department of Transportation infrastructure repairs
- Nearly $2 billion for FEMA special community disaster loans

Total funding request: Nearly $23 billion

CONTEXT:

Currently, approximately 9% of total damage is covered by federal support. Comparable storms like Hurricanes Katrina, Maria, and Sandy received over 70% federal funding. Governor Stein's request would bring federal support to 47%.

Governor Stein has made western North Carolina's recovery a top priority since Hurricane Helene devastated the region last fall. He has worked closely with local officials, state agencies, and federal partners to secure resources and coordinate rebuilding efforts.

The delegation included county commissioners and emergency management directors from the hardest-hit counties who provided firsthand accounts of ongoing recovery challenges and urgent funding needs.
