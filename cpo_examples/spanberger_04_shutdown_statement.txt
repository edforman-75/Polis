Spanberger Statement on Government Shutdown, Trump Administration's Mass Firing Plans

Oct 01, 2025

Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger released the following statement on the government shutdown and the Trump Administration's plans for mass firings of federal workers:

"Virginians are facing enough challenges — from DOGE, reckless tariffs, and attacks on their healthcare coverage. They don't need a President threatening to fire thousands of federal workers or shut down the government.

"We need a Governor who will put Virginia first, no matter who is in the White House or which party controls the levers of power across the Potomac.

"While I'm calling on President Trump to reverse course and work in good faith to end this shutdown, my opponent Winsome Earle-Sears won't even stand up and challenge the potential cuts to Virginia jobs.

"I've spent my career lowering costs for Virginia families, protecting access to affordable healthcare, and always standing up for Virginia jobs and businesses — and that's exactly what I'll do as Governor."

Background:

Virginia is home to more federal workers than any state except Maryland. The Commonwealth's economy depends heavily on the federal workforce, and the uncertainty created by potential mass firings and government shutdowns has devastating impacts on Virginia families and businesses.

Spanberger has consistently advocated for Virginia's interests throughout her time in Congress, including fighting against government shutdowns and protecting federal workers.
