Today, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries appeared on MSNBC's The Briefing with Jen Psaki and CNN's NewsNight with Abby Phillip to emphasize that Democrats are fighting to protect the healthcare of the American people in the face of a reckless Republican government shutdown.

Leader Jeffries criticized the potential government shutdown, expressed concerns about healthcare cuts, and accused Republicans of not negotiating in good faith. He also criticized Donald Trump's behavior and tactics.

Notable quotes from Leader Jeffries:

"We are ready, we're willing, we're able to sit down with anyone, any time, any place to arrive at a bipartisan spending agreement."

"We work for the American people. That's why we've drawn this line in the sand."

"Cancel the cuts, lower the cost, save healthcare."
