Booker, Colleagues Introduce Honor Farmer Contracts Act

March 27, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C.

Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced the Honor Farmer Contracts Act to release illegally withheld funding for USDA contracts and agreements.

The legislation would require USDA to unfreeze all signed agreements and contracts, require USDA to make all past due payments quickly, prohibit USDA from cancelling agreements without cause, and prohibit USDA from closing offices without 60 days notice to Congress.

Key quotes:

Senator Booker: "USDA's refusal to pay what is owed to farmers and organizations that support them is theft, plain and simple."

Representative Vasquez: "When farmers sign contracts, they expect the government to follow through. It's that simple."

Devin Cornia (Northeast Organic Farming Association): "Interrupting farmer contracts undermines our nation's economic, military, and food security."

The bill is cosponsored by 17 senators, including Tammy Duckworth, Peter Welch, Adam Schiff, and others. Representative Gabe Vasquez will introduce companion legislation in the House.
