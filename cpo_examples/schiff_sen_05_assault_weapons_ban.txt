ICYMI: Sen. Schiff and Colleagues Introduce Assault Weapons Ban of 2025

May 2, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C.

U.S. Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) led Senators Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and U.S. Representative Lucy McBath (D-Ga.-06) in introducing the Assault Weapons Ban of 2025.

The legislation was previously championed by his predecessor and mentor in the Senate, the late Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who authored the 1994 ban that passed a bipartisan Congress, and later pushed to revive the ban after it expired in 2004 for the remainder of her tenure.

The bill would ban the sale, transfer, manufacture, and import of military-style assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and other high-capacity ammunition feeding devices.

Key quotes:

Schiff: "The Assault Weapons Ban saved lives. There is no escaping that fact."

Schiff also said of Feinstein: "She wasn't just a champion for protecting communities from gun violence. She is one of the lawmakers who helped prove to all of us that it was possible to deliver results."

The press release indicates that while the 1994 bill had bipartisan support, currently only Democrats have signed on to co-sponsor the legislation.
