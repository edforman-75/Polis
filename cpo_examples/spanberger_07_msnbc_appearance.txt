ICYMI: On MSNBC, Spanberger Calls Out Winsome Earle-Sears for Refusing to Stand Up to Trump's Mass Firings

RICHMOND, Va. — Oct 03, 2025

Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger last night called out her opponent — Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears — on MSNBC's "The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell" for refusing to say that President Trump must stop firing Virginians as he vows to implement mass layoffs amid the government shutdown.

"You heard my opponent, the current Lieutenant Governor — not only has she defended DOGE from the earliest days of the initial DOGE efforts, but she has time and time again refused to stand up for Virginians, for our economy," said Spanberger.

"It is clear that we need a Governor who will stand up for Virginians and make clear that these continued attacks, month after month after month, on the public servants and government contractors who call Virginia home are not only detrimental to the livelihoods of those individuals, but they are devastating to communities across Virginia," she continued.

"My thoughts and my concerns are with the Virginians who are impacted by this shutdown. We know that across Virginia, families are worried about what comes next," said Spanberger.

"Across Virginia, people are impacted by rising costs and the mass loss of jobs is only adding dire insult to injury. And it's not what we need here in Virginia. I am running to serve Virginians, to stand up for Virginians, to lower costs for Virginians, and to push back against an aggressive administration that is seeking to wreak havoc on the lives of Virginians and our economy," she added.
