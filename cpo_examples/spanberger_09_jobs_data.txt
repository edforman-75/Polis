NEW DATA: U.S. Businesses Shed Jobs as Virginians Face Economic Uncertainty

RICHMOND, Va. â€” Sep 2025

Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger remains focused on protecting jobs and growing Virginia's economy as new data show private sector employers are shedding jobs and Virginia businesses are facing increasing financial uncertainty.

"Amid the Trump Administration's DOGE attacks, tariff policies, and tax law driving up costs for Virginia families and causing chaos for businesses big and small, this report underscores that Virginians need steady leadership to get the Commonwealth's economy back on track," said Connor Joseph, Communications Director for Spanberger for Governor.

Key details:
- ADP National Employment Report shows U.S. private sector businesses lost 32,000 workers in September
- August's employment growth was revised down from 54,000 to a loss of 3,000
- Virginia recently lost its CNBC ranking as "America's Top State for Business"
- Virginia's unemployment rate has risen for seven consecutive months

In July, Spanberger announced her "Growing Virginia Plan" focused on protecting jobs, workforce training, and business investment.

A University of Virginia forecast projects virtually no job growth in 2026 due to "delayed federal layoffs and tariffs."

The release also highlights Spanberger's previous business-related endorsements, including from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 2020 and 2022.
