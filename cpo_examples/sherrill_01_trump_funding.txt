While Trump Rips Away Funding, Jack Refuses To Stand Up For New Jersey — Again

Mikie is taking the fight to Trump, Jack’s trying not to piss off his boss

BLOOMFIELD — Today, Mikie Sherrill pledged once again to “fight tooth and nail” to complete the Gateway Tunnel Project, the nation’s most important infrastructure project that is crucial to fixing New Jersey’s broken transit system. 

Jack Ciattarelli knows this project is critical. But, he is squirming and refusing to fight these attacks on New Jersey. Because, as always, Jack’s focused on serving Donald Trump, not New Jersey.
 

When asked who is to blame for the shutdown, Jack said “I don’t know enough about the details.” News flash — it’s his boss, Donald Trump. 
 

When asked about the Trump administration’s move to pause the project, Jack said “it doesn’t stop what’s going on” How does Jack expect the project to continue after Trump ripped away the funding? (You would think a CPA could figure that out) 

Jack has no interest in serving New Jerseyans — as a candidate or as governor. On the debate stage last week, he promised Trump he won’t sue him on anything. This comes after Jack has said his job as governor would be “to help Trump” and refuses to name a single thing he disagrees with Trump on.

Mikie is running to take on anyone — including her own party — to fix New Jersey’s broken transit system, build the Gateway Tunnel, and deliver for working families.
