Consumer Protection Attorney and Former Congresswoman Katie Porter Launches Campaign for California Governor

Katie Porter announced her candidacy for California Governor today, releasing a poll showing her as the clear Democratic frontrunner.

"What California needs now is a little bit of hope and a whole lot of grit... That's why I am running for Governor," said Porter.

Porter previously served three terms in Congress, representing Orange County. She was first elected to Congress in 2018, flipping a historically Republican seat. She is known for holding Trump administration officials accountable.

"As Governor, I'll bring all voices to the table to hear new ideas no matter who they come from," Porter stated.

Porter currently teaches at UC Irvine School of Law and is a single mother of three, living in Irvine, California.

"I've only ever been motivated by one thing â€” making Californians' lives better," she said.

The campaign refuses corporate and lobbyist contributions and emphasizes fighting for working families. Porter highlights her consumer protection background as key to her candidacy.
