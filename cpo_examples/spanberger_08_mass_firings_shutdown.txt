WHAT VIRGINIANS ARE SEEING: Spanberger Slams Trump Administration's Promised Mass Firings Amid Shutdown

RICHMOND, Va. — Oct 03, 2025

Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger — as President Trump vows to implement the mass federal firings recommended by Russell Vought, his Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) — continues to speak out against the dire impacts of the Trump Administration's attacks on Virginians' jobs and Virginia's economy.

"When you have an OMB director saying that they're going to start mass layoffs, that doesn't signify, in any way, a good-faith effort to work to end this shutdown," said Spanberger.

"The idea that the president would use the shutdown to escalate the attacks on the federal workforce even further is an egregious attack on Virginians," she added.

"While my opponent refuses to tell President Trump to stop firing Virginians, I've been speaking out against this sledgehammer approach since January — because Virginia deserves a governor who is going to stand up for Virginia jobs, no matter who is in the White House," said Spanberger.

The press release highlights media coverage from WTOP, Richmond Times-Dispatch, and Politico, discussing the potential economic impact of the government shutdown and mass firings on Virginia. Spanberger criticizes both the Trump administration's approach and her opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, for not standing up for Virginia workers.
