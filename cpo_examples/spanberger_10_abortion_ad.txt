NEW TV AD: Winsome Earle-Sears Supports An Abortion Ban With No Exceptions For Rape Or Incest

RICHMOND, Va. â€” Sep 2025

The Spanberger for Governor campaign released a new TV and digital ad highlighting Winsome Earle-Sears' record of opposing reproductive rights for Virginia women, including supporting a near-total abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest.

The new ad, titled "Wicked", highlights Sears' statements, including:
- "I can't support abortion"
- Supports making abortion a felony
- Calling abortion "wicked"

The ad notes that Sears:
- Left a handwritten note saying she is "morally opposed" to the proposed constitutional amendment protecting reproductive freedom
- Voted against the Right to Contraception Act

Spanberger contrasts this by saying she will:
- Sign the Right to Contraception Act into law
- Support Virginia's proposed constitutional amendment
