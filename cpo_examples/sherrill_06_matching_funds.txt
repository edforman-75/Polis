Mikie Qualifies for Matching Funds with $600K Fundraising Haul After First Day in Governor's Race
WEST CALDWELL — As of the first 24 hours since launching her campaign, Mikie Sherrill raised more than $600,000 with Democrats across New Jersey rallying around her vision for a different type of leadership and a fresh perspective in Trenton. This historic raise allows the campaign to qualify for matching funds under New Jersey's public financing program.

"Mikie is bringing something different to this campaign — a new type of leadership for New Jersey, forged through nearly 10 years in the U.S. Navy, and a fresh perspective to achieve big things for the people of this state. The enthusiasm and support for Mikie's vision has been exciting and encouraging as she introduces herself to New Jersey voters and travels across the state to hear both their concerns and aspirations for our future," said spokesperson Sean Higgins.

On top of her massive fundraising haul, Mikie also earned endorsements on Monday from the New Jersey Firefighters Mutual Benevolent Association (FMBA), the state's most prominent firefighters union, and EMILYs List, the nation's largest organization dedicated to electing more pro-choice Democratic women to office.

Today, on the second day of the campaign, Mikie is on the road to hear from New Jerseyans about the issues that matter most and what they want for our future. She will stop by Eva's Village in Paterson to visit with New Jerseyans in need along with Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh. Then, she will visit with LiUNA members working at the Rutgers Cancer Institute construction project in New Brunswick. Next, she will speak with patients and providers at the Visiting Nurses Association's (VNA) Red Bank Community Health Center. Finally, the tour will end in Atlantic City with the New Jersey FMBA — the state's largest firefighters union.
