May 13, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced he is placing a hold on all Department of Justice political nominees following the Qatari government's $400 million private jet gift to President Trump.

Key points from Schumer's remarks:

He called the jet gift "so corrupt that even Putin would give a double take."

Demanded answers about the deal, including security modifications needed for the plane, potential costs to taxpayers, who in the Trump Administration initiated the deal, and potential national security risks.

Highlighted other business deals between Trump and Middle Eastern entities, including $2 billion from a UAE venture capital firm, new Trump Hotel in Dubai, and potential beachside golf course in Qatar.

Criticized Republicans for "silence" and "total obeisance" to Trump.

Pledged to continue pushing for transparency and answers about the arrangement.

Schumer will maintain the hold on DOJ nominees until he receives comprehensive answers about the Qatari jet deal.
