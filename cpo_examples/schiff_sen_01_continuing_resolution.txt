STATEMENT: Senator Schiff Opposes Flawed Partisan Continuing Resolution

March 12, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C.

U.S. Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) released the following statement on the continuing resolution:

"I will not be voting for the partisan bill coming before the Senate that will further cement the Trump Administration's chaos and reckless actions that are hurting working families and our economy. This bill would allow Donald Trump, Elon Musk and illegal DOGE operators to continue shutting down parts of the government that help our constituents – like veterans' services, Social Security offices, firefighters, bird flu experts, and much more. It would also perpetuate Trump's economy-busting tariffs by putting them beyond congressional repeal.

"Republicans control the House, Senate, and the White House. By choosing to send such a fatally flawed bill to the Senate, Trump and Republicans seem intent on shutting down the government unless they can double down on their damaging cuts. I urge them to reconsider. The Senate has the opportunity to negotiate a short-term funding deal – one that would enjoy broad bipartisan support and actually tackle the pressing challenges of rising costs and growing uncertainty. That's what Americans deserve."
