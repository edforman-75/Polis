JEFFRIES, SCHUMER STATEMENT ON THE TRUMP SHUTDOWN

October 1, 2025

Today, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer released the following statement:

After months of making life harder and more expensive, Donald Trump and Republicans have now shut down the federal government because they do not want to protect the healthcare of the American people. Democrats remain ready to find a bipartisan path forward to reopen the government in a way that lowers costs and addresses the Republican healthcare crisis. But we need a credible partner.

Over the last few days, President Trump's behavior has become more erratic and unhinged. Instead of negotiating a bipartisan agreement in good faith, he is obsessively posting crazed deepfake videos.

The country is in desperate need of an intervention to get out of another Trump shutdown.
