WASHINGTON, D.C.

U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) released the following statement in regard to comments made against her by state representative John Gillette of Arizona:

"Two days ago, an elected member of the Arizona State House of Representatives called for me and those who advocate for nonviolent resistance training to be 'tried, convicted and hanged.' This is appalling, unacceptable, and dangerous from anyone, but particularly from an elected official. It is a call to violence designed to suppress nonviolent democratic organizing against authoritarianism and further polarize the American public for political gain. Sadly, it makes the world a more dangerous place for each of us.

"We simply cannot normalize this violent political speech. All political leaders, of all parties, should denounce this and embrace one another as equals, deserving of care and respect.

"My trainings, which have reached over 15,000 people in all 50 states, explicitly teach about Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi's principles of nonviolent resistance. They give people a voice and a means to effect change without resorting to the exact sort of violent escalation that Representative Gillette is calling for. I intend to continue to train and organize for nonviolent change in our country that lifts up all people and preserves our democracy."
