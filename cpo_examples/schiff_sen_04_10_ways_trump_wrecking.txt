WASHINGTON, D.C.

U.S. Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) spoke on the Senate Floor to recount President Donald Trump's most unlawful, unconstitutional, and disastrous actions since taking office, emphasizing the deliberate chaos and complete disregard of the rule of law.

In his speech, Schiff laid out the top 10 ways that President Trump has hurt Americans' lives and livelihoods:

Attacking research universities. Taking away food assistance. Destroying alliances with democratic nations. Attacking renewable energy development. Cutting funding for health and science research. Making massive cuts to federal workforce and agencies. Implementing destructive tariff policies. Undermining healthcare. Undermining the rule of law. Destroying "the idea of America."

Key quote: "I will never forgive him for the damage he has done, and for the damage he continues to do, to the very idea of America."

The speech was a comprehensive critique of the Trump administration's policies, arguing that they have systematically undermined American institutions, international relationships, scientific progress, and core national values.

Schiff concluded with a message of hope, stating that "The sun is not setting on our republic" and calling for collective action to restore the country's foundational principles.
