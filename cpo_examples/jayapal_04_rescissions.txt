WASHINGTON, D.C.

U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) released the following statement regarding the Republican rescissions package, which passed the House of Representatives 216-213 after being sent back to the House by the Senate.

"The U.S. Constitution gives Congress, and Congress alone, the power of the purse."

The package rescinds over $9 billion in previously negotiated funding, which Jayapal called unprecedented.

She argued the cuts would harm international aid efforts, stating they would "kill an estimated 300,000 people globally and are expected to lead to another 14 million deaths over the next 10 years."

Jayapal highlighted cuts to public broadcasting, saying they would "devastate many rural communities by stripping away their local news source."

She accused Republicans of "stealing from the American people" and "pathetically lining up behind Trump."

The rescissions package originally passed the House in June, and Jayapal previously voted against it.
