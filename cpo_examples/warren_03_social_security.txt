Washington, D.C.

U.S. Senators including Elizabeth Warren pressed President Trump about potential Social Security retirement age increases. The letter was prompted by comments from Trump's Social Security Commissioner, Frank Bisignano.

"If the Social Security retirement age is increased under your watch, you would be breaking your repeated promises to protect and preserve Americans' benefits," the Senators wrote.

Senators warned raising the retirement age would harm low and middle-income workers. If retirement age is raised to 69, a median-age retiree could lose nearly $100,000 over a decade.

"Americans deserve to retire with dignityâ€”not spend their retirement struggling to make ends meet," the letter stated.

The Senators seek White House answers by October 13th. The press release also mentions the Senate Democrats' "Social Security War Room" as a coordinated effort to fight potential benefit cuts.
