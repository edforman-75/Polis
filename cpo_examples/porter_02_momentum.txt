July 30, 2025

CALIFORNIA â€“ Today, Gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter issued the following statement in response to former Vice President Kamala Harris's decision not to enter the race for Governor of California.

"Kamala Harris is a focused leader and I'm proud of the work we accomplished together on consumer protections during the housing crisis and grateful for her service to California and our country," said Porter.

"Our state faces serious challenges, and Californians know that everything from healthcare to housing is way too expensive," Porter continued.

"Donald Trump is doing everything in his power to make things even harder," she added.

A March poll showed Porter with a 28-point lead among Democratic and No Party Preference primary voters, with her winning 36 points while other candidates poll in single digits.

Porter emphasized her commitment to delivering solutions for Californians and defending the state against the Trump Administration.
