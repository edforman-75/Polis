RELEASE: REP. KHANNA TO INTRODUCE AMENDMENT TO PROTECT AMERICAN CHILDREN FROM LOSING HEALTH INSURANCE IN REPUBLICAN BUDGET

May 20, 2025

WASHINGTON, DC

Tonight at 1am ET, Rep. Ro Khanna (CA-17) will head to the House Committee on Rules markup to introduce an amendment to stop children across America from losing health insurance as a result of the Republicans' budget proposal – including Medicaid and CHIP.

Over 38 million children—or 42% of all U.S. kids—receive coverage through Medicaid and CHIP. That includes care for routine checkups, mental health, developmental screenings, and special medical needs. The numbers that House Republicans have released estimate 8.6 million people including children covered by CHIP will lose coverage as a result of the current budget proposal.

"We cannot move forward with policies that jeopardize the health of millions of children. That's why I'm offering my amendment which prohibits any cuts to Medicaid until the administration certifies that no kids will lose healthcare. My amendment simply asks for proof that no child's coverage is at risk. If Republicans truly believe their bill won't harm children as they have claimed, then this safeguard should be common sense," said Rep. Ro Khanna.
