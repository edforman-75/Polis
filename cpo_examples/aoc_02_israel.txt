Washington, D.C.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined Members of Congress for a press conference calling for the Block the Bombs Act, legislation to block bombs, tank shells, and artillery rounds to the Israeli government.

"The Israeli government has now killed over 64,000 human beings in Gaza. They have massacred civilians indiscriminately, destroyed nearly every hospital, and forced all of Gaza into starvation," said Ocasio-Cortez.

"It is against United States law to provide weapons to forces that commit war crimes," she stated.

"It is time for us to fight for a free Palestine, the release of the hostages, and a diplomatic solution to end the cycle of violence," Ocasio-Cortez added.

The press conference was held with other Members of Congress and advocates who support the Block the Bombs Act. The legislation would prevent the transfer of specific weapons systems to the Israeli government.

In May and July, Ocasio-Cortez previously released statements criticizing Israeli government actions and calling to block weapons transfers.
