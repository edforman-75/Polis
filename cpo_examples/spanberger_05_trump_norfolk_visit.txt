Spanberger Statement on Donald Trump's Visit to Norfolk While He Threatens DOGE 2.0

RICHMOND, Va — Oct 03, 2025

Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger released a statement as Donald Trump is expected to visit Norfolk amid threats to fire more Virginia workers as part of a new wave of DOGE cuts.

"Donald Trump needs to answer directly to Virginians on why he is actively cutting Virginia jobs and hurting the Virginia economy," said Spanberger.

She criticized Trump's "sledgehammer approach to governing" and noted that her opponent, Winsome Earle-Sears, has "defended Trump's firing of Virginia workers at every turn."

Spanberger argued that "Virginians deserve a Governor who will work aggressively to put the Commonwealth's economy first, lower costs, and create good-paying jobs — not stay silent as Donald Trump destroys Virginia jobs."

Background Context:
- A UVA forecast projects virtually no job growth in 2026
- CNBC reported Virginia lost its "Top State for Business" ranking

The press release concludes with a call for economic protection and job preservation in Virginia.
