Mikie Sherrill has gone above and beyond on transparency; "Let’s hope others follow her example"

Jack has refused to release his taxes for nearly a decade. What’s Jack hiding?

BLOOMFIELD — Today, Mikie Sherrill highlighted the need for transparency in Trenton and called on Jack Ciattarelli to “follow her example” and release his federal and state tax returns. 

Earlier today, Mikie unveiled her Transparency and Accountability Agenda, where she will shed light on how state programs are performing and bring accountability to Trenton. Mikie herself has gone above and beyond by releasing “exact values of her finances,” a “greater level of transparency and detail than what [she] is required by law to make public.” During the primary, she also released two years of state and federal tax returns. 

In contrast, Jack has refused to release his tax returns for nearly ten years — making him the only gubernatorial candidate in the general election in over two decades to not do so. What we do know is that Jack made millions in profits peddling misinformation about opioids, leading to an addiction crisis that cost lives and livelihoods. 

“I’ve always held myself to the highest standards of accountability, from my time as a Navy pilot to now as a candidate for governor. I will always go above and beyond to ensure the people of New Jersey know I only answer to them. Transparency and accountability are important — I’m not afraid of it. I think Jack is, since he refuses to release his tax returns or any information about the millions he made profiting off the opioid epidemic,” said Mikie Sherrill.
