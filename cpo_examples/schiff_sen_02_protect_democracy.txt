WASHINGTON, D.C.

U.S. Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) introduced his updated Protecting our Democracy Act in the Senate, relaunching his push to advance his landmark legislative package to curb presidential abuses of power, strengthen checks and balances on the Executive Branch, and add additional guardrails to better protect American democracy.

The legislation, first championed by Schiff as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, includes additional provisions to address numerous new abuses of power that Donald Trump and members of his administration have engaged in since his return to the White House in January.

Key provisions of the legislative package include reinforcing Congress' power of the purse and oversight role, preventing presidents from pardoning family, friends, or themselves, preventing use of government resources for campaign purposes, strengthening protections for federal whistleblowers, and explicitly prohibiting campaigns from soliciting foreign election assistance.

The bill is co-sponsored by several senators including Amy Klobuchar, Andy Kim, Richard Blumenthal, and others.

Schiff stated: "Since returning to office, Donald Trump has accelerated the process of tearing down our system of checks and balances and weakening our democracy."

The legislation is supported by numerous pro-democracy and good government organizations, including Protect Democracy, Public Citizen, and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).
