UNION — Mikie Sherrill for Governor Campaign Manager Alex Ball released the following statement after tonight’s Lieutenant Governor debate: 

“Tonight, New Jerseyans got to see what Dr. Dale Caldwell is all about: service, opportunity, and results. With his background as a pastor, educator, and business leader, Dale brings strong experience, leadership, and empathy that will allow him to tackle the challenges facing our state in a new and innovative way. Mikie and Dale will bring a different kind of leadership to Trenton to lower costs for New Jersey families. 

But Jack has shown time and again that he will put Trump over New Jersey, no matter the cost to families. Jack’s ticket has again put taxes on the table. Jack has voted to raise taxes in every office he’s held, backs Trump’s tariffs even if New Jerseyans feel ‘pain,’ and supports kicking 300,000 New Jerseyans off their healthcare. 

The contrast couldn’t be more stark — Mikie and Dale are fighting for New Jersey families while Jack is fighting for Trump.”
