Booker Statement on Trump Shutdown

October 1, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C.

U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) issued the following statement after Donald Trump and Republicans forced the government to shut down:

&quot;If Republicans were serious about keeping the government open, they would have come to the table to address the health care crisis they have singlehandedly manufactured. President Trump and Republicans control the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. Together, they put forth a budget without any input from Democrats, and repeatedly refused to work across the aisle to negotiate a funding bill that could address the pain their policies have caused and actually earn Democratic support.

&quot;The American people should not have to pay the price of their inaction. While premiums continue to soar, hospitals are shutting down, and millions are at risk of losing their health insurance, my Republican colleagues have chosen partisanship over doing their jobs.

&quot;I made it clear from the beginning: I will not give away my vote so the Republican party can continue to raise our costs, jeopardize our health care, and hurt the people of New Jersey. I will continue to fight for a better path forward for the American people, and I urge my Republican colleagues in Congress to negotiate a bipartisan solution that works for this country.&quot;
