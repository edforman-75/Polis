   - Choose action: Accept, Reject, Modify, or Add to KB
   - Add comments as needed
4. **General Comments**: Add overall observations or KB suggestions

   - Add notes explaining the suggestion
   - Submit to KB pending queue

2. **General KB Suggestions**:
   - Use general comments section
   - Click "ðŸ’¡ Suggest for KB"
   - Categorize suggestion type
   - Automatically tracked for implementation

## Usage Examples

### 1. Setup Queue (First Time)
```bash
node scripts/setup-validation-queue.js
```

This will:
- Load all Spanberger press releases
- Analyze them for issues
- Display queue summary
- Show first item preview

### 2. Review Press Releases

1. Open `http://localhost:3001/validation-review.html`
2. Enter your initials (e.g., "ABC")
3. System automatically loads first item
4. Review each issue:
   - **Accept**: If correction is correct
   - **Reject**: If suggestion is wrong
   - **Modify**: If you want different correction
   - **Add to KB**: If pattern should be remembered
5. Add general comments if needed
6. Click "Complete Review" to move to next item

### 3. Check Reviewer Stats
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/validation/stats/ABC
```

### 4. Review KB Suggestions
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/validation/kb-suggestions
```

## Knowledge Base Enhancement

### How It Works

1. **Reviewer Identifies Pattern**:
   - Notices recurring issue or correction
   - Clicks "Add to KB" on issue or adds general comment
   - Selects KB entry type and provides notes

2. **System Captures**:
   - Original text and correction
   - Category and type
   - Reviewer who suggested it
   - Supporting evidence (linked issues)

3. **Pending Queue**:
   - All KB suggestions stored in `validation_kb_pending`
   - Admin reviews and approves
   - Once approved, added to:
     - Custom terminology dictionary
     - Learned rules
     - AP Style exceptions

4. **Automatic Application**:
   - Approved KB entries automatically applied to future reviews
   - Pattern learning improves over time
   - Reduces duplicate flagging

### KB Entry Types

- **custom_term**: Campaign-specific names and terminology
- **style_rule**: Messaging style preferences
- **exception**: AP Style exceptions for this campaign
- **capitalization_rule**: Context-specific capitalization

## Statistics & Reporting

```javascript
{
  "pending": { count: 10, avg_score: 75, total_issues: 120 },
  "in_review": { count: 2, avg_score: 80, total_issues: 15 },
  "completed": { count: 5, avg_score: 85, total_issues: 45 }
}
```

### Reviewer Stats
