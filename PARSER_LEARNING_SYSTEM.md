# Parser Learning System

## üß† Overview

The press release parser now learns from user corrections to improve accuracy over time!

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Tracking**
When you import a press release and make corrections:
- ‚úÖ Every field edit is tracked
- ‚úÖ Original vs. corrected values are recorded
- ‚úÖ Patterns are learned from corrections
- ‚úÖ Accuracy metrics are updated

### 2. **Learning Process**

```
User imports press release
         ‚Üì
Parser extracts fields
         ‚Üì
User makes corrections
         ‚Üì
System records:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong
  ‚Ä¢ What was correct
  ‚Ä¢ Why it might have failed
         ‚Üì
Parser learns patterns
         ‚Üì
Next import is more accurate!
```

### 3. **What Gets Learned**

- **Quote patterns**: How quotes are formatted in your org
- **Dateline formats**: Specific location/date styles
- **Headline structures**: Common headline patterns
- **Speaker attribution**: How people are referenced
- **Field relationships**: Dependencies between fields

## Features

### Automatic Learning
No manual training needed - just use the editor normally!

```javascript
// Happens automatically:
1. Import press release
2. Edit fields as needed
3. System learns from your edits
4. Next parse is better!
```

### Accuracy Metrics
Track parser performance over time:

- **Per-field accuracy**: See which fields parse best
- **Correction frequency**: Identify problem areas
- **Confidence scores**: Know when to trust the parser
- **Historical trends**: Watch accuracy improve

### Pattern Recognition
The system learns:

- Common quote formats in your releases
- Organization-specific terminology
- Speaker name variations
- Date/location preferences
- Structural conventions

## API Endpoints

### Record a Correction
```javascript
POST /api/press-release-parser/feedback/correction
{
  "sessionId": "session_123",
  "originalText": "Full press release text",
  "parsedResult": { /* original parsed data */ },
  "correctedResult": { /* user's corrections */ },
  "fieldName": "headline",
  "originalValue": "Old headline",
  "correctedValue": "Corrected headline"
}
```

### Get Accuracy Metrics
```javascript
GET /api/press-release-parser/feedback/metrics
GET /api/press-release-parser/feedback/metrics?field=headline

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "metrics": [
    {
      "field_type": "headline",
      "total_parses": 150,
      "correct_parses": 135,
      "corrections_made": 15,
      "accuracy_rate": 0.90
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get Learned Patterns
```javascript
GET /api/press-release-parser/feedback/patterns/quote

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "patterns": [
    {
      "pattern_type": "quote",
      "pattern_text": "\"...\", said [Speaker]",
      "confidence_score": 0.95,
      "success_count": 25,
      "failure_count": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get Improvement Suggestions
```javascript
GET /api/press-release-parser/feedback/suggestions

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "field": "dateline",
      "accuracy": 0.65,
      "issue": "Low accuracy - review patterns",
      "commonCorrections": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Frontend Integration

### Basic Setup
```javascript
import { ParserFeedbackTracker } from './js/parser-feedback-tracker.js';

const tracker = new ParserFeedbackTracker();

// After importing a press release:
tracker.startTracking(originalText, parsedData);
tracker.setupAutoTracking();
```

### Manual Tracking
```javascript
// Track specific field changes
const headlineInput = document.getElementById('headline');
tracker.trackFieldChange('headline', headlineInput);
```

### View Metrics
```javascript
// Show accuracy dashboard in console
await tracker.showAccuracyDashboard();

// Get specific metrics
const metrics = await tracker.getMetrics();
console.log('Headline accuracy:', metrics.headline);
```

## Database Schema

### parser_feedback
Stores all corrections made by users:
- `original_text`: Full press release text
- `parsed_result`: What parser extracted
- `corrected_result`: User's corrections
- `field_name`: Which field was corrected
- `original_value`: Parser's extraction
- `corrected_value`: User's correction

### parser_patterns
Learned patterns from corrections:
- `pattern_type`: Type of pattern (quote, dateline, etc.)
- `pattern_text`: The actual pattern
- `confidence_score`: 0.0 to 1.0
- `success_count`: Times pattern worked
- `failure_count`: Times pattern failed

### parser_metrics
Performance tracking:
- `field_type`: Field name
- `total_parses`: Total attempts
- `correct_parses`: Successful parses
- `corrections_made`: Number of user fixes
- `accuracy_rate`: Success percentage

## Example Workflow

### First Import
```
User imports: "Smith Says Education Funding Critical"
Parser extracts: headline = "Smith Says Education"
User corrects: headline = "Smith Says Education Funding Critical"

System learns:
  ‚úì Headlines often include full context
  ‚úì Don't truncate at first verb
  ‚úì Pattern: [Speaker] Says [Full Topic]
```

### Second Import
```
User imports: "Jones Says Healthcare Reform Needed"
Parser uses learned pattern
Parser extracts: headline = "Jones Says Healthcare Reform Needed"
User makes no correction ‚úì

System updates:
  ‚úì Pattern confidence increased
  ‚úì Accuracy improved
```

### After 100 Imports
```
Headline accuracy: 95%
Quote extraction: 92%
Dateline parsing: 88%

Parser now understands your organization's style!
```
