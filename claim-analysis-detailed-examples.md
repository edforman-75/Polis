## EXAMPLE 1: Warren on Government Shutdown

**File:** warren_01_shutdown.txt
**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Type:** Senate floor remarks / press release

### ALL STATEMENTS EXTRACTED:

#### STATEMENT 1: "Republicans...shutting down the government"
**Classification:** ✅ **FACTUAL CLAIM**
**Type:** Direct factual (event occurred)
**Verification Needed:** Did government shut down? When? Who controlled Congress?
**Requires WebSearch:** YES (Oct 2025 - after knowledge cutoff)

**WebSearch Required - Will verify below**

---

#### STATEMENT 2: "Democrats want to keep the government open"
**Classification:** ❌ **NOT A FACTUAL CLAIM**
**Category:** INTENT/MOTIVATION (unverifiable internal state)
**Reason NOT fact:**
- Describes what Democrats "want" (internal desire)
- Cannot be objectively verified
- Motivation/intent claims are inherently subjective
- Would need mind-reading to confirm
- **Can only verify:** What Democrats SAY they want or VOTE for (actions), not actual desires

**Alternative factual claim:**
- "Democrats voted for X bill" ✅ Verifiable
- "Democrats said they want Y" ✅ Verifiable (attribution)
- "Democrats want Y" ❌ Not verifiable (claims to know intent)

---

#### STATEMENT 3: "Republican cuts...will cost 15 million Americans their health care coverage"
**Classification:** ❌ **NOT A FACTUAL CLAIM (as stated)**
**Category:** PREDICTION / FUTURE SPECULATION
**Reason NOT fact:**
- Uses "will" (future tense)
- Predicts outcome that hasn't occurred yet
- Cannot verify future events
- May be based on projections, but projection ≠ fact

**What COULD be verified:**
- "CBO projects cuts will cost 15 million..." ✅ (attribution to CBO)
- "Similar cuts in past resulted in X coverage loss" ✅ (historical data)
- "Analysis shows potential loss of 15 million" ✅ (attribution to analysis)

**Classification of underlying data:**
- IF there's a CBO report: Report exists = FACT
- Report's projection = Attribution (verify report exists, contains this number)
- "Will cost" as definitive future = NOT FACT

---

#### STATEMENT 4: "Republicans control the House, Republicans control the Senate, Republicans control the White House"
**Classification:** ✅ **FACTUAL CLAIM**
**Type:** Direct factual (political control/majority)
**Verification Needed:** Who controls each branch as of Oct 2025?
**Requires WebSearch:** YES (after knowledge cutoff)

**WebSearch Required - Will verify below**

---

#### STATEMENT 5: "They have failed"
**Classification:** ❌ **NOT A FACTUAL CLAIM**
**Category:** VALUE JUDGMENT / CHARACTERIZATION
**Reason NOT fact:**
- "Failed" is evaluative language
- Requires judgment about what constitutes failure
- Different people define "success/failure" differently
- Subjective assessment of performance

**What COULD be verified:**
- "Government shut down" ✅ FACT
- "No funding bill passed" ✅ FACT
- Whether this constitutes "failure" ❌ Opinion/judgment

---

#### STATEMENT 6: "potential negative impacts...including disruptions to healthcare, childcare, and government services"
**Classification:** ❌ **NOT A FACTUAL CLAIM**
**Category:** SPECULATION / POTENTIAL OUTCOMES
**Reason NOT fact:**
- "Potential" = may or may not happen
- "Negative" = value judgment
- Lists possibilities, not actualities
- Cannot verify things that might happen

**What COULD be verified:**
- "Previous shutdowns disrupted X services" ✅ (historical fact)
- "Shutdown is currently disrupting X" ✅ (present fact, if true)
- "Shutdown may disrupt X" ❌ (speculation)

---
