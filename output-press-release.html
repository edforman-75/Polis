Jane Smith Announces Comprehensive Economic Recovery Plan

WASHINGTON - Jane Smith today unveiled a bold economic recovery plan that will create jobs, reduce the deficit, and restore fiscal responsibility to Washington.

&quot;For too long, Washington has failed to deliver real solutions for American families,&quot; said Smith. &quot;While politicians play games, hardworking Americans are paying the price. That ends now.&quot;

The comprehensive plan addresses several critical areas:

Job Creation and Economic Growth

Our plan will create 50,000 new jobs in the first year through targeted infrastructure investments and support for small businesses.

More than 25% of VA workers are veterans, demonstrating our commitment to those who served.

Fiscal Responsibility

The deficit has doubled in the last two years, placing an enormous burden on future generations. Our plan takes a balanced approach to deficit reduction.
