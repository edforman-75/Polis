# Text Quality Analysis System

## Overview

Comprehensive text analysis system that checks **all body text** (not just quotes) for quality issues including run-on sentences, passive voice, vague language, and more.

## Key Features

✅ **Run-On Sentence Detection** - Multi-criteria detection with specific details
✅ **Paragraph Analysis** - Length, readability, coherence checks
✅ **Passive Voice Detection** - Identifies overuse of passive constructions
✅ **Vague Language Detection** - Flags non-specific terms
✅ **Filler Word Detection** - Identifies unnecessary qualifiers
✅ **Jargon Detection** - Catches overused political clichés
✅ **Sentence Variety** - Ensures varied rhythm
✅ **Text Statistics** - Word count, sentence count, averages

## Run-On Sentence Detection

The analyzer uses **three independent criteria** to detect run-on sentences:

### Criterion 1: Word Count
- Single sentence exceeds **35 words**
- Example: A 46-word sentence about healthcare gets flagged

### Criterion 2: Conjunction Density
- **3+ coordinating conjunctions** (and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet) in one sentence
- Example: "We need education **and** support teachers **and** expand access **and** provide resources"

### Criterion 3: Clause Complexity
- **4+ clause indicators** in one sentence:
  - **Commas** (separate clauses)
  - **Subordinating conjunctions** (because, although, since, while, when, if, unless, until, before, after, though, whereas, as)
  - **Relative pronouns** (who, which, that, where, whose, whom)
- Example: "Education is important**,** but we also need healthcare**,** **and** we must address climate change**,** **which** affects everyone**,** **while** ensuring economic growth**,** so **that** all families can thrive" = 8 clause indicators

## Quality Issues Detected

### 1. Run-On Sentences (Penalty: -15 pts, Severity: Warning)
Multiple criteria as described above.

**Example:**
```
❌ "We need to invest in education and we need to support teachers and we must

## Integration Examples

### During Press Release Parsing

```javascript
// Parse the press release
const parsedRelease = await parsePress Release(rawText);

// Analyze body text for quality
const textAnalysis = await fetch('/api/text-analysis/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: parsedRelease.bodyText
  })
});

const analysis = await textAnalysis.json();

// Flag issues for editor
if (analysis.analysis.overallScore < 70) {
  showWarning('Body text has quality issues that need attention');
  displayIssues(analysis.analysis.issues);
}

// Show run-on sentences specifically
const runOns = analysis.analysis.issues.filter(i => i.type === 'run_on_sentence');
if (runOns.length > 0) {
  highlightRunOnSentences(runOns);
}
```

### Real-Time Analysis During Editing

```javascript
// Debounced analysis as user types
let analysisTimeout;
bodyTextField.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
  clearTimeout(analysisTimeout);
  analysisTimeout = setTimeout(async () => {
    const analysis = await analyzeText(e.target.value);
    updateQualityIndicator(analysis.overallScore);
    displayIssuesSidebar(analysis.issues);
  }, 1000);
});
```

### Live Quality Score Display

```javascript
function updateQualityIndicator(score) {
  const indicator = document.getElementById('quality-score');
  indicator.textContent = `${score}/100`;

  if (score >= 85) {
    indicator.className = 'quality-excellent';
  } else if (score >= 70) {
    indicator.className = 'quality-good';
  } else if (score >= 50) {
    indicator.className = 'quality-needs-work';
  } else {
    indicator.className = 'quality-poor';
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run Analysis on All Body Text** - Check entire press release, not just quotes
2. **Fix Run-Ons First** - They have the highest penalty and biggest impact on readability
3. **Be Specific** - Replace vague terms with concrete details
4. **Use Active Voice** - Makes writing more direct and engaging
5. **Vary Sentence Length** - Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
6. **Remove Filler Words** - They weaken the message
7. **Avoid Jargon** - Use fresh, authentic language
8. **Target 70+ Score** - Below 70 indicates significant quality issues

## Performance

- Analyzes full press release (500-1000 words) in <100ms
- Identifies specific locations (paragraph, sentence number)
- Provides actionable suggestions for each issue
- Calculates detailed statistics
