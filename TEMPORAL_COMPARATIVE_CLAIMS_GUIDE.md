# Temporal & Trend Comparative Claims - Complete Guide

## Overview

The system now handles **3 types of comparative claims**:
1. **Standard comparisons** - Comparing two contemporary values
2. **Temporal comparisons** - Comparing current vs. past values
3. **Trend comparisons** - Analyzing ongoing changes over time

---

## New Capabilities

### 1. Temporal Comparisons

Claims that compare current metrics to past values.

#### Patterns Detected

**A. Temporal Comparison** (`temporal_comparison`)
- Pattern: "higher/lower than it was in [time]"
- Examples:
  - "Unemployment is lower than it was in 2019"
  - "Crime is higher than it was last year"
  - "GDP is greater than it was a decade ago"

**B. Temporal Ratio** (`temporal_ratio`)
- Pattern: "double/triple/half what it was [time] ago"
- Examples:
  - "Our deficit is double what it was two years ago"
  - "Inflation is half what it was last year"
  - "Revenue tripled what it was in 2020"

**C. Temporal Change** (`temporal_change`)
- Pattern: "increased/decreased from/since [time]"
- Examples:
  - "GDP has increased from 2020 levels"
  - "Crime is down since last year"
  - "Spending decreased from 2019"

#### Verification Process (Temporal)

**4 Steps:**
1. **Identify metric and timeframe**
   - Extract: metric name + time reference
   - Example: "deficit" + "two years ago"

2. **Look up current value**
   - Sources: Official statistics, recent reports
   - Example: Current US deficit = $1.7T

3. **Look up historical value**
   - Sources: Historical data, archived statistics
   - Example: 2023 deficit = $1.4T

4. **Calculate and verify relationship**
   - For "double": Is $1.7T ≈ 2 × $1.4T?
   - Result: $1.7T / $1.4T = 1.21 (NOT double, closer to 1.2x)
   - Verdict: **FALSE**

---

### 2. Trend Comparisons

Claims about ongoing changes over time.

#### Patterns Detected

**A. Ongoing Trend** (`ongoing_trend`)
- Pattern: "keeps/continues getting [direction]"
- Examples:
  - "The deficit keeps getting bigger every year"
  - "Prices continue rising month after month"
  - "Unemployment keeps declining"

**B. Periodic Trend** (`periodic_trend`)
- Pattern: "[metric] is [direction] every [period]"
- Examples:
  - "Inflation is increasing every quarter"
  - "Crime is declining every year"
  - "Enrollment grows each month"

**C. Sustained Trend** (`sustained_trend`)
- Pattern: "consistent/steady [direction]"
- Examples:
  - "Consistent growth over five years"
  - "Steady decline in poverty"
  - "Continuous rise in temperature"

**D. Multi-Period Trend** (`multi_period_trend`)
- Pattern: "has [direction] for [N] consecutive [periods]"
- Examples:
  - "Revenue has increased for 10 consecutive years"
  - "Emissions have declined for 5 straight quarters"
  - "Growth has continued for 3 consecutive decades"

#### Verification Process (Trend)

**4 Steps:**
1. **Identify metric and time period(s)**
   - Extract: metric + period frequency
   - Example: "deficit" + "every year"

2. **Look up recent values**
   - Collect data points for recent periods
   - Example: Deficit for last 5 years

3. **Look up historical baseline**
   - Get earlier data for comparison
   - Example: Deficit from 5-10 years ago

4. **Calculate trend and verify**
   - Calculate direction: increasing/decreasing
   - Calculate magnitude: rate of change
   - Verify consistency: check all periods
   - Example: Deficit increased 4 out of 5 years → "keeps getting bigger" is TRUE

## Automated Verification Framework

### How It Works

The system provides a **verification framework** that:
1. Detects the claim type
2. Generates verification steps
3. Identifies data sources
4. **[Future]** Automates lookups via WebSearch API

### Current Status

✅ **Detection** - Fully operational
✅ **Step Generation** - Fully operational
✅ **Search Query Generation** - Fully operational
⚠️ **Automated Lookup** - Framework ready, needs WebSearch integration

### Search Query Generation

The `generateSearchQuery()` method creates optimized queries:

```javascript
parser.generateSearchQuery("US deficit", "last year")
// Returns: "US deficit 2024 site:treasury.gov OR site:cbo.gov"

parser.generateSearchQuery("unemployment rate", "2020")
// Returns: "unemployment rate 2020 site:bls.gov"

parser.generateSearchQuery("GDP growth", null)
// Returns: "GDP growth 2025 site:bea.gov OR site:worldbank.org"
```

**Smart Source Targeting:**
- GDP → BEA, World Bank
- Deficit/Debt → Treasury, CBO
- Unemployment → BLS
- Inflation → BLS, Federal Reserve

### Verification Framework Example

```javascript
const claim = "Our deficit is double what it was two years ago";

// Step 1: Detect
const detection = parser.detectComparativeClaim(claim);

// Result:
{
  is_comparative: true,
  comparison_type: "temporal_ratio",
  metrics: ["deficit"],
  time_reference: "two years ago",
  is_temporal: true,
  verification_steps: [
    {
      step: 1,
      action: "identify_metric_and_timeframe",
      metric: "deficit",
      time_reference: "two years ago"
    },
    {
      step: 2,
      action: "lookup_current_value",
      description: "Look up the current/recent value of the metric"
    },
    {
      step: 3,
      action: "lookup_historical_value",
      description: "Look up the value at the referenced time point (two years ago)"
    },
    {
      step: 4,
      action: "compare_or_calculate_trend",
      description: "Verify that the relationship holds between current and past values"
    }
  ]
}

// Step 2: Verify (async)
detection.original_sentence = claim;
const verification = await parser.verifyComparativeClaim(detection);

// Result:
{
  claim_text: "Our deficit is double what it was two years ago",
  comparison_type: "temporal_ratio",
  verdict: "MANUAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED",
  notes: [
    "Identified metric: deficit, time reference: two years ago",
    "WebSearch function not provided - cannot complete automated verification",
    "Manual verification required using the generated steps"
  ],
  supporting_data: {
    current_value: "Requires WebSearch",
    historical_value: "Requires WebSearch",
    difference: "Requires calculation after lookup"
  }
}
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Temporal Ratio

**Claim:** "Our annual deficit is double what it was two years ago."

**Detection:**
- Type: `temporal_ratio`
- Metric: `deficit`
- Time reference: `two years ago`
- Verification needed: Compare 2025 vs 2023

**Manual Verification:**
1. Look up 2025 deficit → $1.7 trillion (projected)
2. Look up 2023 deficit → $1.4 trillion
3. Calculate ratio: $1.7T / $1.4T = 1.21
4. Is 1.21 ≈ 2.0? **NO**
5. Verdict: **FALSE** (increased by 21%, not doubled)

---

### Example 2: Ongoing Trend

**Claim:** "The deficit keeps getting bigger every year."

**Detection:**
- Type: `ongoing_trend`
- Metric: `deficit`
- Pattern: "keeps getting bigger"
- Time reference: `every year`

**Manual Verification:**
1. Look up deficits for last 5 years:
   - 2025: $1.7T (proj)
   - 2024: $1.8T
   - 2023: $1.4T
   - 2022: $1.4T
   - 2021: $2.8T

2. Analyze trend:
   - 2021→2022: Down (−$1.4T)
   - 2022→2023: Flat ($0)
   - 2023→2024: Up (+$0.4T)
   - 2024→2025: Down (−$0.1T)

3. Direction: **MIXED** (not consistently "bigger every year")

4. Verdict: **FALSE** (deficit varies, not consistently increasing)

---

### Example 3: Temporal Comparison

**Claim:** "Unemployment is lower than it was in 2019."

**Detection:**
- Type: `temporal_comparison` (or `less_than` with time reference)
- Metric: `unemployment`
- Time reference: `2019`

**Manual Verification:**
1. Look up current unemployment → 3.7% (November 2024)
2. Look up 2019 unemployment → 3.5% (average)
3. Compare: 3.7% < 3.5%? **NO**
4. Verdict: **FALSE** (slightly higher, not lower)

---

## Integration Points

### Database Storage

Temporal and trend claims are stored with:
- `claim_type` = "comparative_computational"
- `verification_type` = "multi-step-comparative"
- Additional fields in JSON:
  - `is_temporal`: true/false
  - `is_trend`: true/false
  - `time_reference`: extracted time period
  - `verification_steps`: customized for temporal/trend

### API Usage

```javascript
// Extract claims (includes all types)
const facts = parser.extractProvableFacts(text);

// Filter for temporal claims
const temporalClaims = facts.filter(f =>
  Array.isArray(f.type) &&
  f.type.includes('comparative-claim') &&
  f.verification_type === 'multi-step-comparative' &&
  (f.is_temporal || f.is_trend)
);

// Verify a claim
for (const claim of temporalClaims) {
  const verification = await parser.verifyComparativeClaim(claim);
  // Process verification result
}
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. WebSearch Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)

Enable fully automated verification:

```javascript
// Future: Pass WebSearch function
const verification = await parser.verifyComparativeClaim(
  claim,
  async (query) => {
    // Call WebSearch API
    return await webSearch(query);
  }
);

// Would return:
{
  verdict: "FALSE",
  confidence: 0.95,
  supporting_data: {
    current_value: "$1.7 trillion (2025)",
    historical_value: "$1.4 trillion (2023)",
    ratio: 1.21,
    expected_ratio: 2.0
  },
  sources: [
    {url: "treasury.gov/...", title: "2025 Deficit Report"},
    {url: "cbo.gov/...", title: "Historical Budget Data"}
  ]
}
```

### 2. Time Series Data APIs

Integrate with:
- **FRED API** (Federal Reserve Economic Data) - US economic data
- **World Bank API** - International economic data
- **BLS API** (Bureau of Labor Statistics) - Employment, inflation
- **Census API** - Demographic data

### 3. Trend Calculation Engine

Automatically calculate:
- Linear regression for trends
- Year-over-year growth rates
- Consistency scores (how many periods match claimed trend)
- Statistical significance

### 4. Natural Language Results

Convert technical verification into readable summaries:

```
Input: "Deficit keeps getting bigger every year"

Output:
"MOSTLY FALSE - The deficit has increased in 3 out of the last 5 years,
but decreased in 2 years. This is not 'every year' as claimed.

Data:
2021: $2.8T
2022: $1.4T (↓ 50%)
2023: $1.4T (→ flat)
2024: $1.8T (↑ 29%)
2025: $1.7T (↓ 6%)

The trend is variable, not consistently increasing."
```
