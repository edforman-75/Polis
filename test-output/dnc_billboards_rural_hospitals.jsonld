  "articleBody": "ICYMI: New DNC Billboards Outside Shuttering Rural Hospitals Blame Closure on Trump's Gutting of Health Care\n\nJuly 23, 2025\n\nYesterday, the DNC launched new billboards outside rural hospitals that have been forced to close or cut back services as a direct consequence of Donald Trump's Budget Betrayal that delivers the largest redistribution of wealth and the largest cut to health care in modern history. Under Trump's watch, residents in Silex, Missouri; Columbus, Indiana; Stilwell, Oklahoma; and Missoula, Montana are now forced to go without the lifesaving care they need â€” and the DNC is making sure they know exactly who to blame. The billboards also direct passersby to TrumpTax.com, an interactive website that spotlights how Trump's Budget Betrayal is skyrocketing costs, burning holes in working Americans' pocketbooks, and screwing over everyday Americans.\n\nThe press release then includes excerpts from various media coverage, including quotes from DNC Chair Ken Martin such as:\n\n\"Rural hospitals were already on the brink of collapse thanks to Donald Trump, but now he has put the last nail in the coffin for rural hospitals with his billionaire budget bill. In states across the country, hospitals are either closing their doors or cutting critical services, and it's Trump's own voters who will suffer the most. This is what Donald Trump does, screw the people who are counting on him.\"\n\nThe billboards read messages like \"Under Trump's Watch, Providence St Patrick Hospital is Closing its Maternity Center\" and are part of a campaign to highlight the alleged negative impacts of Trump's domestic policy bill on rural healthcare.\n",
