Smith Announces Weekend Canvass Launch to Register New Voters

CLEVELAND, OH – October 15, 2025 – Congressional candidate Jane Smith today announced a grassroots canvassing effort launching this Saturday to register new voters ahead of the upcoming election.

"Some say voter registration isn't important, but we know every voice matters in our democracy," Smith stated at a press conference this morning. "This weekend, our volunteers will knock on thousands of doors across the district."

The canvass launch will begin at 10 AM on Saturday at the campaign headquarters located at 123 Main Street. Volunteers will receive training and materials before heading out into neighborhoods.

According to recent polling, many believe turnout will be decisive in this race. Smith's campaign has set a goal of registering 5,000 new voters before the registration deadline.

"We're building a movement that puts people first," Smith added. "Whether it's healthcare, education, or jobs, working families deserve a champion in Congress."
