Governor Smith Unveils Plan to Expand Healthcare Access to 150,000 Uninsured Residents

BOSTON, MA - October 1, 2025 - Governor Sarah Smith today unveiled a comprehensive plan to expand healthcare access to 150,000 uninsured Massachusetts residents. The initiative will provide affordable coverage and prescription drug benefits to working families across the Commonwealth.

"Too many families in Massachusetts are forced to choose between paying rent and buying medicine," said Governor Smith at a press conference this morning. "That's wrong, and we can do better."

The plan includes three major components: expanding Medicaid eligibility to families earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, creating a prescription drug affordability board to negotiate lower prices, and establishing community health centers in underserved areas.

Health policy experts estimate the program will cost $2.1 billion over five years, funded through a combination of federal matching funds and a small payroll tax on high earners. The initiative has broad support from healthcare advocates and business leaders.

The healthcare expansion bill will be introduced in the state legislature next week. Governor Smith said she expects bipartisan support for the measure, which has been endorsed by the Massachusetts Medical Society and the Chamber of Commerce.
